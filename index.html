“The Ugly Cost of Fashion” was a great short film; it was entertaining yet very informative. A lot of the information the host went over I already knew from watching other documentaries like the “True Cost” and some other short ones on youtube and TV. One of the biggest shocks to me was how companies produced “green” or “recycled” clothing.
       <br><br>

One of my favorite parts about the show was when it cut to the scene where the host opened up his own knock off store of H&M and Zara. I liked watching all the customers' reactions to how unrecycled the clothes were and how they found out what they were really wearing. In my opinion, one of the funniest scenes was when the host said the only recycled part of the piece of clothing was the price tag. The girl’s face was priceless when he told her that! She was in complete shock to hear that only the price tag was recycled and not the actual clothes. She even said, “I feel like I’m being scammed!”
       <br><br>

It is crazy to think about how fashion now has 52 seasons a year…..ummmm isn’t that a new season per week? Not only that, but since people are buying new clothes they need to buy new accessories, and along with that who all is making this? A lot of the time it comes from people from third world countries who work long hours a day to only make one cent to maybe $3 a day. In watching other documentaries and learning about how these people work more than 8 hours a day (sometimes more than 12) just to scrape by to provide for their families is incredulous. Not only do the parents work in these horrible working conditions but most of the time their kids have to do child labor as well just to get food on the table. A lot of these parents didn’t go to school because they have been working since they were children, and now their kids are having to not go to school and work to help provide for the family as well.

I agree with you in the sense that I also did not know how the industry would lie about their products being eco friendly or made out of recycled material. As a consumer you give a certain level of trust to the brands you buy from and think if they tell me its eco friendly it must be. However, the levels that they go to just to keep selling are honestly frightening. The way they manipulate their wording to claim an item as recycled when it is just the tag is so stupid.
<br><br>

 The fast fashion industry having 52 seasons is also quite frightening to learn about. Companies like to say that they wouldn't put it out if the people wouldn't ask for it but who the hell is asking for 52 weeks of new clothes??? I feel like the short film was very eye opening about how clothes are made and at what cost. The fact that we are polluting rivers that little kids are drinking from is terrible and heartbreaking to hear about. Then in the film the Trust Cost to see the Plaza collapse and kill all these people was incredible hard sad. These people are valuing cheap clothing over the lives of actual people. We need to learn to shop for quality and not quantity. We need to use our clothes longer and buy less.
<br><hr>
I also really enjoyed “The Ugly Cost of Fashion” and Hasan Minhaj’s message of the fast fashion industry’s success at making clothes “quick, cheap, and disposable.” I think that your favorite part of when Hasan opened his own knock off store really shows how out-of-touch we are with the production processes of the things we buy. It also importantly uncovers the danger of what is known as greenwashing, a company’s use of manipulative words to make consumers believe that their products are sustainable and environmentally-sound. Knowing that our generation is aware of the consequences of the climate crisis, we look for ways to individually reduce our carbon footprint as much as we can. As a result, according to Hasan, fashion industries are relying on an appeal to our outlook on environmentally sustainable alternatives, even at the risk of lying.

<br><br>

Fortunately, the ways we can mitigate the effects of fast fashion are fairly simply and already quite popular among our generation. Something as simple as wearing a piece of clothing for 9 months longer reduces one’s carbon footprint for that item by 30%. More notably, thrifting is becoming ever more common and could prevent almost 6 pounds of CO2 emissions from reaching the atmosphere, the equivalent of removing half a million cars a year. This short film was very insightful and ultimately gave me a bit of hope that we can change the way the fast fashion industries are influencing us.

<br><hr>
The true cost behind the fashion industry is scary. In order for consumers to have access to cheap clothing, it cost much more than the thirty dollars which we paid in stores. In fact, we are not just taking advantage of the labors in less developed countries, we are making our planet less habitable. In the near future, our next generation will pay for the price which we did not care for when we are making a purchase. The true cost is embedded in multiple stages of production, shipping, and handling. One interesting fact I found is that in your comment, you point out the only recyclable part of the cloths is the price tag. Recalling the last time when you shop online and receive your package of dresses, the first thing you will do is to try your new clothes and toss the price tag away. Ironically, we are in fact throwing away the only recyclable part of our clothes! These unaccounted costs would be paid for by the next generation. Thus, we should realize the vicious cycle of consumerism and act upon it by simply buy less and keep on to our thins longer. As an alternative to fast fashion, we may always visit thrift stores and shop for clothing.

<br><hr>
I agree with your statement about having "52 seasons a year." Sometimes I really wonder why people keep up with certain trends. I can certainly appreciate loving fashion and clothes but we've reached a point where people, especially young people, buy new clothes purely because it's trendy that day. I don't even think they truly like what they wear sometimes, but they saw some Kardashian or Paris Hilton wearing it so now they have to have it no matter what despite if they actually find it cute. It just seems excessive and unnecessary to me.
<br><hr>
I agree. The film points out a lot of ugly things hidden behind the business. Before I watch this movie, I didn't realize that the businessmen would be so unscrupulous for making the profit. What I can think of before is to boost how good their clothes are to raise the price. But I did not expect that there would be so-called “green” and “recycled” clothes.

<br><hr>
I worked in clothing retail, at a mid-range department store (Macy's, if you care to know). When Minhaj says "drowning in clothing" as the model for fast fashion production, I had vivid flashbacks to spending HOURS upon HOURS in the docks unpacking boxes, stripping off plastic bags, and hanging, folding, and adding sensors to garments. We received two shipments of clothing per week, plus whatever trucks came randomly. Everything looked so similar: the jeans varied by a single rip, the dresses by a pleat or a button, and suits by the width of the lapel. I couldn't imagine everything selling at a rate to warrant how many articles we put out on the floor, but people bought it. Everyone is ravenous for cheap clothing. Everyone believes in the fundamental right to express themselves through their fashion choices. It's unbelievable. When I was first hired, I was ecstatic about the fact that I would be paid $0.50 above the legal minimum wage in California. I later decided that the amount of manual labor I did deserved more than a measly extra $0.50. I then thought about the people, often women and minors, in factories internationally who get paid much, much less for much, much longer hours. I don't think there's a single level in the fast fashion chain where the employees are treated with even a fraction of the same prestige as people like Amancio Ortega, who is worth $70 billion. I didn't realize that fast fashion made the owners so incredibly wealthy. It was naive of me, but I thought that the CEOs and owners were moderately wealthy; that low wages and cheap materials only allowed for low prices and not necessarily the massive accumulation of personal wealth. I was wrong.
<br><br>

I think that "donating" clothes is not a sustainable solution to getting rid of what we don't want. Quoting the episode, a single Salvation Army location throws away "18 tons every 3 days." Six tons a day. That is 12,000 pounds of clothing, in the landfill, every single day. Additionally, thrift stores often bar access from people who need clothes the most. If someone is extremely strapped for cash (unemployed, homeless, dead-end job/suffering from wage theft) then how can they afford to buy what they need from increasingly gentrified thrift stores? Instead of donating our old clothes, they should be separated between "usable" and "unusable." Usable clothes in nice conditions should be donated to nonprofits that will give them away--maybe local churches near where we live or parishes that we attend could help connect these resources with the needy. Unusable clothes can be repurposed: I've made dog and cat toys out of old t shirts and donated them to animal shelters. Ratty t shirts make great cleaning rags, and are good for drying long hair. Like Minhaj said, extending the life of a piece of clothing can greatly reduce its impact on the planet.

<br><hr>
I also found the fact that fashion now has 52 seasons insane! That is so much clothing being made every year that we Americans keep consuming. Most of us don't ever think about how these pieces of clothing are made and how families in undeveloped countries are getting paid a few dollars to make clothes that we sometimes only use once. We donate these clothes we no longer use, thinking we are doing something great but in reality only 10% of the clothes we donate gets resold and the rest of it gets dumped in undeveloped countries. So not only are these people working long hours in poor working conditions they are also receiving these clothes back which is trashing their environment.  
<br><br>

I found it extremely sad when some of the women were explaining how their working conditions were so poor and that often times these factories collapse. Rana Plaza for example was one of the the worst building collapses these people experienced, an eight story building collapsed killing over 1,000 people. Not only do these people have to work in these conditions, they also have to leave their children behind to be able to work. A mother mentioned only seeing her child two times a year in order to be able to provide for them. The film also provides us with information on pesticides and how these harsh chemicals are causing birth defects, seventy to eighty children in every village are born with a disability. This is extremely sad and has to come to an end. However in order for this to happen just like the film mentioned "before you can solve a problem you have to admit you got one... the system as a whole"

<br><hr>


I second everything you said on the comment post. Just like you, I find it crazy to believe that these companies are manufacturing products that are 'green', 'eco-friendly', or 'recycled', when they are the second largest chemical producer in the world? It is truly shocking to see the customers' reactions when they found out that the clothes that they are buying are not or completely, recycled materials. With that being said, I could somehow relate to their reactions as even myself, is part of that group when it comes to buying clothing that are 'stylish' and 'affordable'. It really feels like humanity is being scammed from their own activities, we are all blinded to the fact of profit and the real cost of climate crisis. In the light of fashion having 52 seasons a year, I am not surprise to find that they are constantly making ideas and creating clothes, changing trends almost every day to every week basis. The fashion industry is forcing abusive work environment, along with neglecting what they are doing contributing so much Co2 emission to the planet. All for the sake of profit.



<br><hr>
I agree with the above comments. Corporations like H&M and Zara clearly know what they are doing, advertising their products as “green” and “sustainable” almost as a desperate response to the lashback they’ve received about their unsustainable methods of production. “I feel like I’m getting scammed.” I feel like Hasan’s show included that commentary as an indirect callout to how the fashion industry’s method of appearing eco friendly through false advertisement is indeed a scam to generate more profits without actually helping the planet in any way.

<br><hr>
"The Ugly Cost of Fashion" was a very fun yet informative video to watch. In response to Angie's comment, it is absolutely crazy that the world has 52 seasons a year. It pushes people to keep on buying in so many different ways. The biggest one being the constructed social norm around clothing. People constantly feel the need to obtain more, not just when it comes to clothing. Rampant consumerism is growing and growing and the side effects have been showing. These sweat shop workers work way harder than the average American yet they not only make close to nothing but they also have to deal with all the side effects of fast fashion. Even kids have to work, and it's disgusting to think that the average American is partly to blame for that. It is absolutely crazy that only the price tag gets recycled. Fast Fashion not only increases production but also increases waste. Hasan Minhaj’s message of the fast fashion industry’s success at making clothes “quick, cheap, and disposable" is an important one as it shows you the interests of these big companies and the lack of care they have for the planet or the lives of millions of people.

<br><hr>
I agree that "The Ugly Cost of Fashion" did a fantastic job of presenting information on fast fashion and environmental impacts of it in a really funny and engaging way. I genuinely laughed out loud throughout the video but also didn't feel that the host was minimizing the issue or not getting the point across. I was shocked to learn that Lululemon leggings are made from oil, as this is a super popular brand for girls and has been since high school. Besides myself, I don't think I know a single female my age who doesn't own a pair of Lululemon leggings or at least has coveted them.
<br><br>
The part that stuck out the most to me was when the host mentioned how social media plays into this problem of fast fashion. He was super accurate on saying that the visibility and lack of privacy promoted by social media puts concern over image on an even higher level than before. Since platforms like Instagram reduce your image and appeal to only a series of photographs, there is a huge pressure to "not repeat outfits" or commit any other visual faux-pas. And with the dawn of the era of Instagram promoters, people with millions of followers (who also are paid to model and promote cheap fashion) are encouraging this "wear once, throw away" mindset to American consumers. Most people follow this behavior without once considering the working and living conditions of the people who made these garments because their problems seem so far removed. I think that more visibility of sweat shops and the environmental impacts of fast fashion would help people see the effects of their shopping habits.
<br><hr>
I too, found that the most interesting and entertaining part of the short episode “The Ugly Cost of Fashion was when the host informed his audience on what fast fashion brands really mean when they become “eco-friendly” or “sustainable” It was incredibly entertaining to watch people’s expressions when the host enlightened them on the reality behind vague and meaningless the vague and meaningless words that they used to brand their new “woke” clothing line. However, I too was completely blown away by the extensive loopholes that companies like H&M go through to attract new buyers. These fast fashion companies are simply falsely advertising their product which is totally immoral and disgusting, and to make the situation even more unsettling, they are advertising to buyers that they are making the morally superior choice by buying their new clothing line.  

<br><br>

It is utterly mind-blowing that today the average American buys 68 clothing items per year, keeping these clothing items for only half as long as we did 20 years ago. Society has been literally brainwashed to be rampant consumers, sacrificing time, money and the environment for things that we don’t need or really even use. The only real solution to this institutional problem is for buyers to stop putting money into the hands of corporate criminals and begin supporting local businesses and buying used clothes and goods.


<br><hr>

That's funny because I had the same reaction to hearing about the 52 seasons of fashion. It is crazy how as our values have become so misplaced as a society to point where we degrade the earth for aesthetic purposes. While it is known that many of our clothing comes from people working in inhumane conditions in underprivileged countries, how often do we really think about that when go to purchase a shirt or a new necklace. "The Ugly Cost of Fast Fashion" offers an entertaining insight regarding the realities of fashion. Just for monetary gain, people will not only manipulate consumers, but do so at the expense of the environment and others. Nonetheless, we find ourselves repeatedly buying into this scheme of being fashionable, myself included. I consider myself a fashionable person and have even been called "sneakerhead" or told that I have too many clothes. It definitely takes effort and time to break away from this habit, but it would also be of great help if there wasn't so much attention being constantly drawn to fashion whether it be through advertisements or some alternative medium.

<br><hr>
Though I honestly wasn’t surprised to find out the methods these companies are using to lie about their products (like saying something is “recycled” when only the tag is recycled), I find it hard to believe how they can use this level of dishonesty. Anything to sell the product apparently. This type of advertising, or “greenwashing,” is extremely harmful: it gives a false sense of being environmentally conscious to those who do not do their research before buying, which, I’m willing to bet, the average consumer does not (hence the prevalence of these fast fashion stores in the first place.) Ads like the Zara ad Hasan showed are a perfect example of this. It pairs words like “sustainable,” which has no set definition in fashion and could be used to mean a range of things, with idyllic pastoral imagery, meaning to make the viewer think the product is not harming the environment while giving no actual proof that it isn’t.
<br><br>


I was shocked to hear him say that the average American throws away 80 pounds of clothes per year, and many of these items were only worn a handful of times. This is no doubt because of the quickly-rotating fashion seasons (52 is just ridiculously excessive), but also to the poor quality of these clothes. That’s why donating them instead of throwing them away may not make much of a difference: the quality is so low that they can hardly stand up to repeated wear by their first owner, let alone by a second. So thrift stores ship their unwanted clothes to other countries, who burn them. This is why I think it’s so important to buy clothes second hand. Not only are they cheaper, but they’re generally better quality, as well as better for the environment. This is also why I think it’s cool to see apps like Depop or Mercari where people sell and buy clothes secondhand, because it can open up the market to a wider range of potential buyers instead of just those who might happen to walk into a thrift store.

<br><hr>

I agree with you. "52 seasons a year." Frightening. The fashion industry can mislead people's consumption ideas and blindly pursue new products. Similarly, it is precisely because people keep buying new products that the fashion industry continues to grow. At the same time, they need to keep reducing costs, so they hire workers from third world countries. These workers are in desperate need of money, so they are willing to work in poorly-conditioned factories and accept low salaries.

<br><hr>
I also enjoyed watching the scene of the pop-up shop. I thought it was a good way to inform the shoppers of what their garment was actually made of. I could say I learned something myself about what goes on behind making the clothing items. I also found it surprising that fashion has 52 seasons per year.The amount of clothes produced year round is exceedingly high. As you mentioned, this is only talking about clothes but we must consider what goes on behind making all of it.
<br><hr>
I also thought that "The Ugly Cost of Fashion" was a great film. I already knew many of the facts mentioned, and how horrible fast fashion is, with people being treated horribly in factories in third world countries, and entire families, including children, having to work in abominable conditions to put food on the table for their families. I think I first learned about horrible labor practices from the company American Apparel which always emphasized the fact that they were sweatshop free. 

<br><br>

What I did not know was that huge companies were lying to us about "green" and "recycled" clothing. While I am disgusted, I am definitely not surprised. It's horrible thinking about how many people are scammed into thinking they're doing a good thing by purchasing recycled clothing when in reality it's just the tag. How freaking rude.

<br><br>

While I used to be the type of person who shopped at these large stores because their clothes were cheap, nowadays I usually thrift most of my items or buy pieces from companies that I know have safe and sustainable means of production. Although I'm not the most environmentally friendly person in other aspects of my life (I'm working on it), I think clothing is a really easy thing to make smarter decisions with, especially since my generation is really into thrifting.


<br><hr>
What was most saddening to me when I was reading this was realizing that, very likely, this is my most considerable contribution to both the climate crisis as well as a huge global problem. I buy a lot of clothes. Like, a lot. But I was never really that concerned with my actions impact on the global climate due to the fact that I felt as though I was sheltered from the effects of my consumerism on the climate crisis. I never was able to draw a clear line between clothing, cheap labor in the third world, and the climate crisis. And, as it turns out, this was part of a very purposeful campaign. 
<br><br>
“Greenwashing”, or the act of attempting to seem more ecofriendly than one actually is, is a strategy that I feel as though I have fallen very hard for. I was able to rationalize my consumerism in “artistic expression” and blanket language like “free-trade”, without ever having to see the reality of factories in places like India and Bangladesh. Overall, I now see my contribution to the climate crisis, and exactly what I can do about it.

I can’t believe Americans spend 1.1 trillion dollars during the biggest shopping seasons. I watched the fast fashion video.  The way the video displays how obsessed the world is with shopping and fashion is baffling. My brother just got a huge wage increase and I watched how he moved on to fashion brands that won’t last in his wardrobe. That’s fast fashion. We just like being boujee and luxurious but also comfortable. It’s sad that big companies like GAP, Levis, and Calvin Klein are in a decline in sales even though i do support smaller businesses. I also support wardrobe reassessments; however, the whole making knock offs of brands, even though more affordable, is dangerous given that the manufacturing cycle is sped up and uses up a lot more resources. That’s why you’ll find all the low income people at the swapmeet getting knock off brands when the clothes could be a lot simpler and the demand for seasons could be a lot shorter. It’s all thanks to the digital era, making us insecure about what we wear, like Kim Kardashian. Where 70% of the materials used to make clothes goes to waste anyway.

"The Ugly Cost of Fashion" was an incredible short film; it was engaging yet exceptionally educational. A ton of the data the host went over I definitely knew from viewing different narratives like the "Genuine Cost" and some other short ones on youtube and TV. Probably the greatest stun to me was the means by which organizations created "green" or "reused" attire. I know that Volcom goes out of their way to be more sustainable with their jeans and how they make them, I wish other brands would follow suit. A lot of the surf brands now and days are making more of an effort to be more sustainable and its a really positive message for other brands out there.
<br><br>
One of my preferred parts about the show was the point at which it slice to the scene where the host opened up his own knock off store of H&M and Zara. It appears to be a repetitive topic that what we have to do is basically change the way of life around this theme completely. Much the same as with open transportation, living negligibly, and cooperating as a network, we have to change the perspectives upon the design business. We need there to never again be such a negative meaning around utilizing similar things for a long time, and it needs to rather be strengthened that purchasing recycled garments and keeping a similar garments for a long time is the beneficial activity. We have to advance reusing, diminishing, and reusing our apparel. With dressing, however with each thing that we expend. We additionally need to go to bat for individuals working right now, they have little to nothing to do with the issue, particularly since a large number of their lives rely upon these employments. While I concur that any activity is superior to no activity by any means, it is as yet not right that individuals are working so enthusiastically for so little consequently. I figure an answer for this could be supporting nearby business and attempting to land positions with neighborhood business.

After only minutes of watching this film, I started to get a deep sense of dread. I knew that I was going to be in for a painful 90 minutes. The footage of the sweatshop in India caving in was absolutely horrific. I remember reading about that event in the news when it happened, but seeing video of the hundreds of families waiting outside to try to find a sign of their loved ones alive was astonishing. The families outside reported that they could literally hear screams coming from under the rubble as they were trying to escape. Starting with such a gruesome scene was a bold choice for the filmmakers, but I think it really paid off in terms of packing a strong emotional punch. 
<br><br>
One of the thoughts that I couldn’t get out of my mind while watching this was just how devastating and violent such an event must have been. In the attacks on September 11, 2001, almost 3000 people perished, and it is a day that we think about and grieve to this day, almost two decades later. In this disaster in India, almost 1000 people died. And while such a travesty made international news, the story didn’t last more than a week. I, for one, had completely forgotten that it had even happened only a few years later. I think that illustrates one of the fundamental underlying problems with the way we discuss many global issues, including climate change. Because so much is happening so quickly, the news cycle doesn’t have enough time to really let any major occurrence sink into our collective consciousness. If we had talked about this disaster for months, maybe there would have been some change, but because it was out of sight, out of mind within a week of it showing up, people don’t truly get the emotional impact of such chaos.




</p><hr>


<p>
After watching the film, The True Cost, I was left absolutely heartbroken. Before watching this film I had no idea the fast fashion industry was as brutally evil as it is. After hearing about the Rana Plaza incident, I was in tears. The fact that these people are suffering consequences of big corporations and being paid barley anything is unacceptable. After hering Kate Ball say “it could be worse” for the workers left me angry. I can’t believe this is still going on in the world. I feel bad wearing the clothes I am right now and my eyes have been open after watching this film. I will stop feeding into these corporations and find other alternatives to spend my money on.




</p><hr>


<p>
This film really resonated with me. I felt a range of emotions as I watched it, from anger to sadness to disappointment with myself for being a chess piece in the game of fast fashion and consumerism. The part of the film that really spoke to me was the part that described the factory building collapse in Bangladesh. Over 1,000 people died. That number is shocking, yet it’s difficult to really feel what that means. In the film, it is mentioned how fast fashion has become more than just competing for cheaper prices, but it has become a process in which you ignore other people’s lives. We have become so desensitized to the impact of our consumer choices on other people and on the natural world, that when we see incidents like the Rana Plaza building collapse, we feel a sense of sorrow and sadness, but not enough to question our role in that. One of the garment workers that was interviewed stated that clothes are produced by blood and that lots of workers have died in the factories. It’s just crazy to think of the real impact of your clothes and to consider what all had to happen to make it possible. Another point I felt strongly about was when they were discussing a living wage. It led me to question, Who determines what constitutes a living wage. One of the garment workers discussed her experience in trying to create a union. She was met with brutal violence and rejection. I think we take a lot for granted because we occupy a space of privilege.

<p>
The True Cost was one of the films that hit closest to home for me. I love fashion and clothes. To know that this is one happens behind the scenes, however, it's honestly terrifying. What I used to think of as a form of self expression and art is now a sign of the horrors that humans can cause. Not just environmentally but in terms of compassion for other human beings, all of it is horrible. 
<br><br>
This film actually also inspired me for the future. Knowing all of the bad parts of the fashion industry shows me how I want to change things in the future and the part I can do in the effort against the climate crisis. I hope one day I can go into the fashion industry and fix the problems like these, making the whole field better.




</p><hr>


<p>
This film could not have opened my eyes more than it did by the end. There were so many things I was being informed about, but rather than information that made me joyous about something, all I felt was immense anger at fashion industries and their blatant disregard for those who cannot afford to speak on the conditions in which they work all because they need every dollar that they’re paid. These corporations are the same one who come up with slogans that are better fitting as threats than actual advertisements. 
<br><br>

They spoke about how India has had at least 250,000 farmer recorded suicides within the last 16 years and I couldn’t stomach it. These are not simply people that are being put out of jobs or living a more meager life, but actual lives that are being lost every 30 minutes. It makes me wonder, exactly how much attention and action would be taken if rather than real human lives dropping every 30 minutes, it was the economic stocks of these fashion industries? As a whole society, I do believe we have reached a point of no return.




</p><hr>


<p>

The film exposed the fact that the fashion is another threat of the environment. The merchant make this fast fashion to incite people to buy, which means that the quantity is more important than the quality. In fast fashion, the cloth need to be super cheap to attract the consumers. As the result, all the merchants need to cut the original cost by reducing the worker's salaries. At the same time, clothing's quality is not good so that they all  soon become the waste in one's closet. The idea of this fast fashion need to be changed. People need to shop wisely. Rather than buying clothing that are not going to be worn for long time, buy the clothing that's going to last long.

I absolutely enjoyed this feature we watched. It was engaging and comedic while still getting the point across. The use of imagery and close up physical examples painted an image of how bad consumerism has overtaken us and our planet. The use of statistics in a comparative manner to numbers from several decades ago truly emphasized the tremendous acceleration of waste from fast fashion. As I was watching, I was essentially one with the show’s audience in their shock and disbelief for the results from the habits we continue to adhere to. Honestly, I visualized the stuff that I have in my closet, realized how much I actually use on a regular basis and I started feeling terrible in how much I am impacting the environment. I liked how there were solutions incorporated to the main points introduced, as it implies that there are ways to alleviate one’s personal footprint and amount of waste. The show’s format in general is one that I think would be approachable to all and must not be overlooked.

Watching the film “The True Cost” really opened my eyes to the reality of the fast fashion industry, and how we are conditioned nowadays to always crave new items and new pieces of clothing, even when we don’t need them. I had always known that fast fashion was fast because of how poor the working conditions are; the workers are subjected to harsh product quotas, insufferable work environment conditions (i.e. dirty, scrutinizing supervisors and peers, pest-infested buildings, no air circulation or natural light), and the constant stress of being on top of making clothing for the given trends at any point in time. They’re also paid dirt cheap for the harsh and labor-intensive work they do, allowing the clothes to be sold towards the general public for still lower to average prices, yet still make huge profit margins. It shows the extent to which money and greed can lead businesses to make highly unethical decisions if it ensures that they can make comfortable profit. 
<br><br>

It also fascinates me how much owning new clothing pieces, and materialistic items in general, is now such a huge part of society. The fact that the average American buys 68 pieces of new clothing every year is astounding to me; I had never realized the extent to which consumerism has permeated our sense of self and what we should value having in our lives. Some people believe wholeheartedly in buying as much as they can whenever they can, and celebrities deeply affect this type of thinking because much of the trends and styles that become popular are based around what they buy. Fast fashion companies tune in to what the most popular celebrities wear and when they wear them, and they proceed to force their workers to crank out cheap and disposable copies of those pieces in insanely short periods of time. It’s disgusting but it also is so mainstream and widely utilized by the public that it’s a problem I can’t forsee going away anytime soon.

The film, The True Cost, was very effective when communicating its subject. It achieved this by showing the viewers the behind the scenes of how clothes that we wear are made. This film gave the viewers a new perspective on clothing and the fashion industry. I was shown a whole new side of things and how us, "the consumers" never realize the harm we cause to the environment and just buy more and more. This film wants the people to do something about this major issue that is happening in the world. The films audience is definitely the consumers of the product. This is aimed towards casual viewers because they are not yet aware of this issue and the film is trying to spare awarenesses. My general reaction to this film was how surprised I was. I had no idea about the major impact the fashion industry has had on our world . My response to this film was much more intellectual than emotional. This film really had me thinking about how consumers are basically tricked into buying and buying from major companies, causing lots of harm to the environment. I learned that as humans, we are very selfish and don't really think at all about the consequences of our actions. I honestly think that as a society, we are slowly becoming much aware of these type of things. We are also working more towards bettering our environment and much more people are speaking out to this issues. If I were able to rate this film, I would give it 5 because as a viewer you can see the amount of time and effort this film took. The makers of this film worked hard to make the world see the impact they have on the environment and are trying to focus on now having people do something and have them speak up.

Hasan Minhaj's The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion reveals a startling amount of consumption and waste in our culture. Much like last week's film, this episode of The Patriot Act shows the cost of such consumption and waste. This time, it focuses on the physical results of this culture (the facts, consequences, and misinformation)...and they're UGLY.
<br><br>
The numbers, to me, are horrifying.  From 1980 to 2019, we went from buying 12 new articles of clothing a year to buying 68. Producing cotton for ONE t-shirt takes as much water as 24 years of drinking water for one person, a harrowing realization in face of the knowledge that many places in the world lack clean drinking water. Fast fashion gives off more emissions than international flights and maritime shipping *combined*. Of course we need clothing, but when we get to a point with this much waste, we have to reassess our wasteful culture.
<br><br>
Hearing about the costs of this culture on the environment makes me angry. From poisoning rivers to wasting wood to using crude oil, it really makes me think. If we directly felt the impacts of this culture, we wouldn't continue with it. We wouldn't be able to, if we had our major rivers poisoned and our forests shredded. (Or would we? We continue fracking even though our water's on fire, and we gladly bulldoze over nature to make shopping malls. Maybe I'm too faithful in human nature.)
<br><br>
One phrase that struck me was this: "Fast fashion democratized high fashion." It's a striking image. Like our democracy, fast fashion has an upside for the average American, but is wasteful, full of misinformation, hurts the planet and developing nations, and it seems the young people and those studying it are the the only ones interested in changing this.

I had previously watched the documentary “True Cost” in a course of the sociology of globalization and that’s when I first learned about how incredibly unethical fast fashion is and how it has come to consume the world, especially the western world. Then I watched the “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” and was reminded of how wasteful fast fashion truly is. It was interesting to learn about Zara’s (and other fast fashion stores) tactics for growth and consumer retention. I think it’s very scary how much we don’t know about what goes into making our clothes, and especially what toxic materials are used to produce our clothes. Companies like Zara, Forever 21, H&M have made high fashion so accessible to the average person on their quest to live the life of a celebrity or an influencer. The greenwashing tactics are also scary, because it makes people feel like they are doing a good thing, and are being eco friendly, when in reality that is not the case. I think this brings up a good point that we as humans and consumers need to be aware and make an effort to look into how and if companies are being completely transparent about their environmentally sustainable initiatives.

I had already known that most of our clothing products were sourced from outside the US, but seeing the actual numbers was very surprising. I hadn’t realized that only 3% are from the US, but I am not surprised. Whenever I go to buy clothes and look at the tag at the back, it is usually from countries like Bangladesh and China where the labor is cheaper and easily obtained. This ties in to the Rana Plaza disaster which was something so atrocious. When hearing about this incident, I was absolutely appalled because of the circumstances leading up to it. Because of the neglect of the owners and their selfishness, so many people died in this disaster. The owners had already known that there were problems with the infrastructure, but did not act on it because they wanted to keep the production going. I believe that we should do anything in our power to keep these accidents from happening and not just look for cheap labor. Granted the product will be more expensive, it would be better and deter the consumers from overbuying products which would in turn lead to less emissions. The atrocity that was committed on that day was something that could have been completely avoided had the owners been looking out for the safety of their workers instead of just looking for the most profitable way out. This is due to the competitive nature of the clothing industry. Because of this, everyone is looking for the cheapest and fastest way to put products out without stopping to think about what this could do for the environment which in turn leads to fast fashion. There are so many instances around the world where owners have neglected their workers and forced them to work in unsafe conditions just so they can make a profit and churn out products for the consumers, while most of us, as consumers have no idea what goes on into making the things that we buy. I think we should stop and think about what we can do in order to stop this and bring awareness to this worldwide problem.

I remember having to watch “The True Cost” in my 11th grade English class, and whenever I go into a mall or see stores such as Forever 21 or H&M, I think of this documentary. As someone who has a mild interest in fashion and likes to dress “fashionable,” I have realized that shopping in thrift stores is not only a fun and cheap way to look for new clothes, but also a way to express my creativity. There have been shirts that I find at thrift stores that I cut up and make fashionable, or even jean jackets that I have painted on to make it look almost vintage. I remember one time I was shopping at a fast fashion clothing store and I found a shirt that looked practically identical to a red crop top that I found at a thrift store, yet instead of being $2, it was $19.99. I try to shop as much as I possibly can at either thrift stores or yard sales now, and it seems that our new generation is beginning to do the same. Seeing how much of an impact it has on real people in other countries really stuck in my head. The sad reality is that many people don’t understand what their impact is when buying clothing. I do believe that there is a way to solve this. Similar to a carbon tax, if we made a law to put a label on the tags of clothing that “workers were paid only $2 a day to make this” then there will be a significant decrease in the fast fashion industry. The sad reality is, however, that there is no way that the producer will agree to this. Therefore, I think the best solution for now is to promote local businesses and thrift stores and decrease online shopping and big businesses shopping. I always get shocked when I see people doing clothing shopping during class, it's almost as if that's what they do when there bored, not even when they need anything. I'm very glad that I only throw out clothes if I grow out of them or if they get ruined (like a torn or a stain on them). I just hope that more people will start to understand their impact every time they buy an item.

<p>

Whenever I’m learning about this class I always relate it to my personal experiences. For “The True Cost,” it really wasn’t hard. I can remember going to stores like H&M and Forever 21 ever since middle school: and like it says in the title, I really didn’t know the “true cost.” Though I knew people working in sweatshops were getting extremely low wages and working conditions were more difficult than here in America, this film’s depiction of factory-life in places like Cambodia and Indonesia truly shocked me. I had no idea that workers would get beaten by staff members, were treated so cruelly by police during riots, and had such unsafe, long work hours. 

<br><br>



Standards were rarely ever met for these people’s working environment. It was so sad to see: I couldn’t believe what happened at Rana Plaza when an eight story building collapsed on innocent, determined workers. 921 people left dead for what? So that I can buy a $10 shirt? It really made me feel guilty, as I should. 



<br><br>

With this comes determination for change, though. Organizations like The Green Carpet Challenge are working toward higher pay and a better life for factory workers. We, as a community can start by recycling clothes and being more cautious as consumers. We can inform more people about the effects their decisions have on people all over the world. We can make change. We need to: for their blood is on our hands.

I found "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" very shocking when Hasan Minhaj discussed how a lot of the fabrics were made. I already knew that the consumerism surrounding the fashion industry was bad, since we've made 52 seasons of fashion normal, but knowing that just making the clothes is bad for the environment is new information. I did not realize that a large portion of the fabrics that are used today are made with oil. Learning that Lululemon, a very popular company right now, has a lot of clothes that are made using oil is crazy. Even learning that cotton uses a large amount of water to make it into clothing was shocking since I always thought that was the more environmentally friendly option versus things such as leather or synthetic fabrics. I never realized that saying a fabric was made from a "plasticky material" was weird to say until learning that the material is basically plastic, but we don't view it as such and throw it away without a second thought. I though Minhaj's pop up shop was a really effective way of teaching people about how harmful fashion could be for the planet by simply looking at what the clothes were made out of. 
<br><br>
What really got me the most was the part about how the "recycled and sustainable" clothing was barely recycled or sustainable. The whole "this shirt was made with less water than it is usually made with" when the water was not the actual problem made me angry. I was especially appalled when stores were giving customers discounts for throwing away their old clothes in bins in the stores so that customers would buy more things. I knew that this industry, like most these days, is only interested in making money, but it is upsetting learning about how little they care about the repercussions of their actions.

<p>

With the fact that the average American buys 68 pieces of clothing per year, I took a step back to look at myself to see if I was included. Fortunately, I’m not because of my spending habits, but it still made me ponder as to how that is even considered necessary for anybody. That amount of extra clothing seems incredibly useless considering how much money would be spent on an outfit being used once or twice and then being “retired.” After learning that the fashion industry is the 2nd most polluting industry it made me disgusted as to how glorified high fashion is pushed by the media.



</p><hr>


<p>

I have shopped hundreds of times, maybe almost thousands of times in my lifetimes at fast fashion stores such as Forever21, H&M and Gap just to name a few. Yet, I never really thought of the damage I was doing in shopping for the clothing. To me it was a steal, $5.50 for a cute floral top or $7 for a pair of "jeans," this film taught me that I was right, purchasing these items is a steal; it is stealing from the workers who work in the poorest of conditions, stealing from the planet, stripping it of clean air and handing it all to the heads of the fast fashion industry. I was appalled to learn that "Fashion is the number two most polluting industry in the world, second only to oil." That’s so disturbing to know. I was actively contributing, to this, and in great quantities because of my ignorant consumption over the years. One of the ladies in the film said something that clung to me. She said that we as consumers have the power to make a change, the industry is all based on demand and that if we continue to buy into the trap, we are facilitating the poor treatment of the sweatshop workers. If we as consumers acknowledge these disturbing facts, we can stop consuming from the fast fashion industry and ultimately give ourselves and others better quality lives.

The Film The True Cost really gave a look into how fashion/ fast fashion really has an impact on people. It was really hard and a sad documentary to watch. I think that this documentary is one that everyone needs to watch. American who buy a lot of clothing needs to watch this. This film really has made me rethink everything that I have bought. I knew that fast fashion clothing and shoes are being made some place besides the US. Seeing all the stuff that these people who were primary people of color are going through for the selfish reason is so heartbreaking. I have seen how sweatshops works. I have family who works in these jobs because they need to. These people need to make a living for themselves so they take the shitty jobs that they can find. Capitalism will exploit people to the max in order to get profit. Seeing that lives of these people literally pouring their sweat and tears into making it possible for fast fashion to be possible it crazy and super disheartening to watch. Seeing the scene where they show the collapsed of the building was really hard to watch because those people deserved so much better than what they were getting.

After watching the True Cost I realized how much of a consumer culture the United States has adapted. Nowadays people are very materialistic and care about the things they own in life. The consumer culture negatively impacts people and the environment. We can blame both the consumers and the corporations who sell the products. These corporations are also emitting tons of greenhouse gases from their factories. I was surprised by the fact that the average american purchases over 60 items of clothing per year. This is definitely way too excessive and americans need to buy less and need to learn how to live with less if we want make a change in the climate crisis. It was also crazy to see that the fashion industry has 52 seasons a year. This means every week we are seeing new releases and styles of clothing that people continue to buy. I also found it funny that one of the shirts said it was recycled and the only part that was actually recycled was just the tag. The womans reaction was pretty funny too. We need to start consuming less and use things more efficiently. As a country, we need to start making changes immediately if we want to make a difference.

This film was very interesting and insightful for me to watch as an avid shopper. By offering a closer glimpse into fast fashion and the life of the low wage workers in the developing countries, I feel as if I was able to gain a better understanding of just what happens behind the scenes up until the clothes get on the racks at the shopping stores that I frequent. It was very interesting for me to learn that despite garment manufacturing being a three trillion dollar industry, the working conditions in those countries are poor. I was really stricken by the conditions that these people work in in order to produce these clothes. The fact that these workers work in such dangerous and hot conditions makes me feel for them and makes me not want to buy anymore clothes because it is just fueling this economy of fast fashion that should not exist in the first place. We need to work to change the way that such items are marketed and how the younger generations especially are targeted to wear the next big trend and then throw it to the side when the next new thing comes out.

"The True Cost" opened the curtains behind the fashion industry and the terrible conditions those that that work in it have to live with.  The U.S used to make a lot their own clothing, 95%, but companies have decided to move elsewhere so that they can get around minimum wage.  Now only 3% of clothing is made here and 97%!!! is made in developing counties around the world.   A fact that disgusted me was that the 40 million factory workers (85% of which are women) are only paid $3 an hour in seat shops working away tirelessly.  Meanwhile, the fashion industry is coming off its most profitable year of all time with almost $3 trillion dollars.  United States companies should not be allowed to exploit developing countries for personal gain.  The next time I go shopping I am going to do my research on which stores use sweatshops in developing countries.  I used to go to H&M all the time but now I am definitely going to reconsider when I want something from that store.  The American people can make a difference by not wasting as much.  A statistic from the movie stated that the average American throws away 82 pounds of textile waste totaling out to 11 million pounds of waste from the U.S which is nonbiodegradable.

Some of the statistics that Hasan Minhaj presented in this documentary were very eye opening. Having already watched The Trust Cost, I knew the damage the fast fashion industry had on both the environment and on developing countries. However, the statistics that were displayed in this Patriot Act episode really put things into perspective. For example, in the 1980s Americans were buying only 12 clothing items per year. Now, that number is all the way up to 68. This increase in average clothing items bought per year has a VERY negative impact. With the rise of “fast fashion”, companies are doling out stylish but low quality clothes at higher prices in hopes of people buying at a higher rate. This indeed as worked: Americans seem to be more inclined to buy more and more clothes even if the usage rate of each clothing item is less. In fact, the average clothing item gets worn an average of 3 times per year. This points to a bigger picture -  Americans seemed to be driven by their immediate desires of new fashion and are less inclined to buy conservatively to help the environment. This is not the type of mindset that we can have if we actually want to make an impact. People always ask what they can do individually to help -near the end of the video, Hasan states that if everyone bought just one used item for one year, it is equivalent to removing half a million cars from the road.

The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion made me aware of how much I have been contributing to the fast fashion industry. Fashion is a big part of our culture and it was not surprising to learn that we buy around 68 new pieces per year. I am guilty of buying many clothing items and cleaning out my closet every season to make room for more. I donate clothes very often, but after this video I know that even by donating I am still harming our environment. It amazes me that the amount of clothing purchases has increased compared to the 1980s where people only bought about 12 new pieces in a year. What is very shocking is that we go through 52 seasons per year. I can’t even imagine how much clothing items are being produced daily. Becoming aware of this issue has really made me want to step back from my shopping habits. Knowing that by wearing clothes longer than 9 months or buying one used item is like taking ½ million cars off the road encourages me to not give into fast fashion.

The film The True Cost has taught me a term that I had not even known about before: fast fashion. All my life I’ve been living under the guise that buying cheaper is always better. Now I realize that not buying and consuming was the best option. The True Cost does a great job at exploring the world of fashion and the lengths that many of these corporations will go through to maximize their profit. I did not know about the cruel injustices and inhumane conditions many of these workers have to endure to get us our pieces of clothing and garments. I am astonished to know that the fashion industry has such an impact on our world as the oil or meat industry. I guess I had not realized because I have greatly gotten used to this way of life and thinking. This is in part due to the corporations and their need to not only get us to buy their products, but to maintain its consumer culture. Without people willing to buy, these companies would not attain their beloved cash and profit flow. Watching this film has made me realize that I have such terrible spending habits. I will strive to change my ways and not continuously fall under this addiction that many of us face when it comes to buying things and consuming more and more. If films like The True Cost were more widespread, then perhaps we could ultimately change the way our societies think and act. As appreciative as I am for learning this valuable information, it pains me that I had to take a course just to learn how companies manipulate and exploit me. Instead, our internet feeds are just filled with useless trash that’s promoted as “life changing” or “new and improved.”

The U.S leads in the consumption of stuff and it is not hard to believe when we have the most innovative people in our country.  However, it is not the company of United States to blame, it is the consumers. I say its both the industries and the consumers who obviously contribute to the true cost of buying new objects. In the movie, "The True Cost" it actually depicts what it means to make ends meet. Their lives are being jeopardized by working long hours for minimum wage in unsanitary conditions and many hazards around them. However, these workers need to take actions where they're at as well. They cannot just keep working there so other countries can have goods at the cost of their safety. Yes the industries need to take action too and make sure their workers' are always safe and their lives are never put in danger. It is heartbreaking to me that some factory workers can just keep doing what they're doing just because they're too lazy to try and do anything else. All in all it is an entire chain of everyone's fault and not one side is to blame here.

The film "The True Cost" shows the impacts of the fashion industry. I have watched this film in multiple classes, because it shows issues that are not only environmental as we see them now but also humanitarian. It is really eye opening to watch this film now that I also have another perspective on what the fashion industry is doing and how it is affecting our environment. Every time I watch this film, it is just as heartbreaking to see the conditions people who make our clothes live in. It is sad to think that while we use shopping as a form of pleasure it is at the cost of someone's misery. Once again, we see how the poor suffer while the rich make situations worse. 
<br><br>

It is even more sad to think that even if the fashion industry was cut down, many people would lose their jobs. They are stuck in a system that continues to worsen. In reality, the consumers are the problem, because we want cheaper prices to be able to buy a lot more than we should.

“ The true cost” really pushes me to think deeply about the dark side of fashion industry. For normal women, there are only three points in life: buy, buy, buy. Zara and H &amp; M are just heaven to satisfy desire for less rich girls. The two fast fashion industry leaders are cheap enough to keep up with fashion. Why can they be so cheap? Why is the cost low? Because the fabric they use is poor. Zara was exposed to toxic cotton one year. Later, I don't know why it didn't have a great impact on the brand, and the profits are still rising year by year. As far as I know, everyone's attitude towards Forever21, Zara and H M is to wear them for one year and throw them away. Most of the materials they use are non degradable, even when they are buried in the soil, they emit toxic gas. The most important thing is the problem of human capital. The salary of sweatshops is not up to standard, and the environment is comparable to hell. Take Bangladesh and Cambodia for example. Workers work like zombies. They are greedy from the beginning to the end, but their wages do not meet the minimum wage standard, so they cannot maintain their basic life. It’s a shame for the fashion industry to gain benefits in such conditions.

This week’s film is a very enticing piece of media to watch but intentionally alarming at the same time. In this episode of Patriot Act, I was horrified by the facts given on What is the true cost of the fashion industry? On the surface it seems like its just clothes but underneath huge losses and exploitation is undergoing. Cost of water pollution, labor, deaths from factory accidents, farmers that don’t have access to health care and education, etc. These are only some of the underlying factors of the ugly truth of fast fashion. Systemic change is necessary and the only solution. On top of the fact that we are exploiting our planet to create these products, we are exploiting people in third countries for cheap labor to keep our lavish costumes possible. These workers are not happy and they don’t want their kids to have to work in factories and fields like them, but the outlook doesn’t look good for their kids either as well. Americans are literally destroying millions of non-American lives as well as American lives.

I really enjoyed how informative the video was and how Hasan Minhaj was able to convey seriousness but also include his comedic style with it. I think it's very appropriate for a variety of audiences, especially those who aren't as informed about the reality of fast fashion.
<br><br>

As someone who has admired the creative aspect of fashion and the artistry behind it, it truly pains me to see how much fast fashion has escalated. Rather than just sticking to their own unique style and brand, many major companies are competing against one another to try and produce the "next big thing" in order to maximize profits. Not only does fast fashion take so much away from the core values fashion has, it also puts a major stress onto the earth and its environment. With the increasing trend of shopping sustainably, I hope major brands can realize that going green is what younger generations want, and it's something that we'll keep in mind the next time we shop.

The sheer evil instilled into those who own big corporations, especially centered around fashion, is cast into a whole new and unthinkable light within this film, and is absolutely life changing for the viewer if they felt anything like I did after viewing this documentary. I never got behind/supported companies when they decided to outsource their manufacturing to save money as I believe it's disgusting how much people in these developing countries are being paid, but I did understand why companies did it. The occurrence at Rana Plaza, however, is a whole different kind of messed up. It’s almost unbelievable to think that workers making no more than 3 dollars an hour are being forced to risk their lives in a complex which is visibly unstable for a check that in the United States, would be worse than asking for spare change on the street. The fact that big business has such a hold on these foreign manufacturers is surreal, as you wouldn’t think that wages this low would ever be sought after by someone of the human population. Richard Wolff says it perfectly in the film. He states that the “real problem is the system itself” as it's so “based on materialism”. If it weren’t for this 52 week fashion season we are now starting to see in cheaper stores such as H&M, the atrocities currently happening within the industry across the globe wouldn’t be occurring. We normalize commercial interests so much that it seems alright that we as a population consume 64 items of clothing a year, when in reality the fashion industry is playing a huge role in destroying our Ozone and limiting the amount of future we have left. If we, the human race, don’t come to an understanding that the constant consumption and waste of clothing items is contributing just as heavily as some other big issues concerning climate change, then we may have to come to the exception that we won’t be here for that much longer.

I thought that the Hasan Minaj video describing the toll that fast fashion brands such as FashionNova and H&M have on the environment. I'm somebody who has succumb to H&M, but more than anything I think the problem lies within consumerism. Whenever my mom is unsure of whether she really likes the fit of a shirt or not, I always encourage her to buy it. I think, "She'll end up wearing it at some point anyway, and for that price, it's a steal!" These shirts are rarely worn by her, and sometimes they are donated straightaway. It's something that always ends up going under my radar, and she doesn't think anything of it too. Now, I feel almost selfish by considering price over anything else that defines a product. My favorite sweater used to be one that I bought from H&M. After a few washes, it began to lose the softness and became itchy and scratchy on my skin. I had no choice but to toss it out, despite the design, and frankly, that just shows how little care is put into every product produced by these brands, which is why it makes me sad that stores such as GAP and Abercrombie and Hollister are starting to move into this cycling of fast fashion. Their products are enjoyable, but the market for them is starting to pale in comparison to fast fashion brands, forcing them to pick up their pace and churn out items with low quality, and even lower regard for the humans who made them. It's despicable, and when Hasan mentioned Zara's CEO Ortega, I was absolutely appalled to see somebody who had such low regard for people being as rich as he was, and more than anything, exhibits the attitudes of powerful people when it comes to saving the planet that they've manipulated to work in their favor.

The Ugly Cost of Fast Fashion educates the audience about the truth and issues behind the fast fashion industry. In the video, the director used many real life footage and interviews to let people understand the situation better and to support its main idea that people are buying way more clothes than they actually need. People love the fast fashion industry because they can purchase high fashion products at a much lower price and dispose them quickly. It gives the example that the Balenciaga shoes cost people about 800 dollars, but Zara gives people a 60 dollar choice to own a pair of similar shoes. The fast fashion industry is now slowly killing the traditional brands like Levis and CK. It is shocking to learn about the reason that the fast fashion industry can be so “fast” and the ways they are knocking off other brands. This industry gives up the whole process of designing, but just copying from other brands and from celebrities. It offers the normal people the chance to look fashion and “expensive”.

At the same time, the industry is also killing the Earth that tons of greenhouse gases are emissioned due to the manufacturing process. And in order to use cotton to make clothes, millions liters of water are used. The water that is used to grow the cotton for one jacket can be used for one person’s drinking water for 24 years. Those statistics are scary and make people uncomfortable that behind those glamourous looks so many resources are wasted. And synthetic fabrics are even worse that they use almost 342 million barrels of oil every year. People really need to be informed and aware of those numbers that buying less clothes can also save the planet.

I respect Hasan Minhaj and how he uses his platform and captivating humor to shine a light on prominent issues. Watching this, not only informed the audience on many issues involving the fast fashion industry, but it also made hilarious jokes along the way in order to make the topic more relatable. Not only did he explain how Zara and H&M are dominating the fashion industry over the family companies such as Gap, levis, etc, but he made a comparison of their domination to white people taking over yoga. Also I felt like he made a point to empathize with the public for falling for these industries tactics, and showed us what they do in order to curb our trust in them than villainize the consumer for falling into the world of fast fashion. I believe Hasan Minhaj’s way of communicating the issue of fast fashion is a very effective way of shining a light on the issue because it makes the topic more digestible to a skeptical audience. Sometimes an intense documentary such as “The True Cost” can scare people away because it will be too hard for people to watch. I remember when I watched it a couple of years ago, I cried all night because i never realized how horrible shopping from these brands were for our environment and third world countries. However, “The True Cost” spurred my love for thrifting and really made me think before my purchases. Facts such as the clothing industry creating more greenhouse gases than all international flights and maritime shipping is a hard pill to swallow. I had no idea. But the message is such an important one to spread and I think if new, innovative ways like hasan minhaj’s Patriot Act series start covering these issues, more change will happen.

A feeling of dread followed me as I watched the film, “The True Cost,” about the horrors that follow the ever-growing fast fashion industry.  When most people think of the great deals that come along with cheaply made clothing, the reality of brutal working conditions, little-to-no human rights, and disabled children as an effect of factory pollution do not come to mind.  These are the harsh realities that millions of factory workers face everyday to keep up with the rapid seasons of the fast fashion industry.  Disasters like the Rana Plaza collapse should never happen again if the presence of the fast fashion industry were to not be so prevalent right now.  They are also the reasons why consumers should not be partaking in the purchasing of any of these clothing items so frequently.  Seeing as keeping a single clothing item for a longer period of time will reduce your carbon footprint significantly, minimalism is what we should be striving for.

The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion communicated a lot of the same information as The True Cost but it was funny and the communicator of the information, Hasan Minhaj, makes himself someone the audience will listen to because he doesn’t act above this kind of consumption. People can be very defensive when their lifestyles are criticized so it makes a big difference when information like this to comes from someone the the audience can relate to. Humor also plays a big role in making the audience more comfortable and accepting of this information. In a general way, to answer Ken’s question about future communication of climate issues and solutions, I do think the combination of a relatable communicator and humor make people much more willing to listen to things that they may otherwise be more dismissive of or take more personally. Like food, our idea of what we should pay for clothing is so warped by fast fashion. The True Cost says it with its name, there are costs of our cheap food and clothing that we don’t see unless we dig for them. Someone, somewhere pays the cost when we buy a ridiculously cheap item of clothing and our planet certainly pays. It will be hard to shift expectations about cost but overall we just need to be more conscious consumers no matter what we are buying. I understand lots of reasons why people don’t want to or don’t feel like they can cut down on consumption of animal products but I don’t really understand any reason someone can understand the truth of the fashion industry and continue consuming like usual. Cost wise, thrift stores are less expensive than fast fashion stores.

The film The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion reveals the negative effect of fast fashion. Living in a peaceful country since born, there is no way for us to know what lies behind the fast fashion. What we can see, touch and feel is the super quick changing style of ZARA, H&M, GAP. You will go out of style just after one week of not expanding your closet. This film, however, tells us the dark side of the fast fashion that lies on both of the supply side and demand side. Through the film, I know the damage capitalism does on less-developed countries, including health care problem, and environment pollution. More surprisingly, managers of these companies obviously do not care about the workers back in Bangladesh. From the perspective of the demand side, we spend money buying clothes that have similar functions to those we already have. Well, to solve this situation, I would say a good way is to reduce our consumption-just not buy any more of those unnecessary items. Furthermore, this is a good way to reduce carbon emission as the more the clothing factories produce, the more carbon they emitted. Another good way is to promote fair trade which is to set regulations on encouraging corporations like People Tree.

This documentary showed the truly evil side of the fashion industry. Not only is our environment getting destroyed from the overall increase in clothing, but third world countries, too. While we enjoy our perfectly made clothes and new products, these people are suffering in inhumane conditions just to be able to survive. We really are so naive to the world around us, and it is films like these that I really wonder what change could happen if more people were to see the atrocities occurring just for American consumers to wear a jacket one time. In addition, I had no idea that clothing was this detrimental to the environment and climate crisis. I assumed that it was pretty much all the major fossil fuel oil industries, but never the large clothing industries that we think of every day as innocent. I want to know how this large topic of consumerism and mass production of clothing that will mostly go to waste can be stopped. It makes me angry to see poor people suffering because of the greed of the rich, especially when the rich don't even really know that they are causing such a huge problem. Education is the most important tool in changing the consumer culture and therefore reducing climate change. This documentary will surely show more people how unmanageable we are making our world live in. Hopefully then really change can be made and the climate crisis will be helped out even a little bit.

After watching Hasan Minhaj's "The Patriot Act", I was really surprised by the ways that companies try to market their fashion as sustainable when their products are completely unsustainably sourced. The most disturbing part to me was the label that said "This was made of recycled material," but only talked about the label and not the article of clothing itself. I personally try to thrift, repurpose, and share as much clothing as possible, but have been guilty of going to stores similar to Zara and purchasing clothing thinking it was sustainable or less detrimental than other shops. Now I know to put in deeper research and am inspired to focus more on repurposing the clothing I already own, and saving my money instead of spending it on harmfully sourced fashion. I
<br><br>
I would also like to note a great organization that helps to prevent the negative cycle of clothing local to our own community is the Isla Vista Trading Post. They pick up clothing donations from people in IV, then redistribute them to lower income communities and allow students to take three free pieces home (at literally no cost whatsoever) home after events. I think focusing on communal living and giving will help a lot in the battle against fast fashion, and being able to develop your own personal style rather than following fast-fashion trends that are switched up every week on Fashion Nova and Forever 21 is really empowering!

There’s a common sense that producers are always paying more efforts on producing a variety of goods to serve consumers’ needs. However, the truth is that they are also creating new consumers for their products, which means that they are creating a new culture to persuade people that their products are vital part of their life. In the advertisement strategies, one technique is to connect the products with some positive tags like wealth, beauty, power, wisdom, or anything that humans are always pursuing and would be willing to pay for. The commercial companies are also trying to initiate people’s desire to hold more and purchase more items, changing the unnecessary replacements into necessary replacements by decreasing the quality of the products. However, under consumerism, people are gradually making the planet inhabitable by fulfilling their increasing desires. Although the price of the items are lower, the damage we made to the environment is the irreparable loss, which is the true cost.

<p>
It is exceedingly concerning how our culture is often dictated by what the industry wants to sell. As a result of the constant advertising and trending that occurs over all forms of media, we develop preconceived ideas of what we should or shouldn't like. I think this is especially damaging to children, who can be easily influenced by what they see other people do. This is one of the reasons, in my opinion, that the fashion industry has only gotten increasingly more problematic as the years have progressed. As mentioned in the film "The True Cost," fashions seasons lasted a fourth of the year, depending on the actual season of the year so that people could dress accordingly. However, in order to achieve, maximum profit, we continue to produce more and more, now having a total of 52 season in a single year! This number to me is nearly incomprehensible and is a good example of our the corporate mentality continue to affect our lives and how we act. I think many people fail to realize all the degradation and negativity that occurs as the result of this. Lives are lost, people work under terrible working conditions, and the industry only becomes more problematic.

The fashion industry is one of the fastest changing economies, there are now over 50 “seasons” in one year, essentially meaning that fashion brands are coming out with new lines of product every week. Fast fashion is even worse, by copying luxury brands and making almost identical clothing to expensive brands at only a fraction of the price. Brands such as Fashionnova are creating products almost as soon are they are seen on social media being worn by celebrities. Young consumers become quickly attracted to the idea that they can buy the same dress as for example Kylie Jenner for only 30 dollars. They will wear that dress only a handful of times and quickly discard it as soon as a new dress comes out. Before watching this incredibly entertaining video I wasn’t full aware of the devastating consequences of the fast fashion industry. I wasn’t aware of the pollution it causes and the thousands of lives it affects by rendering river water unsafe to drink. We only pay attention to what we want to as consumers and we are happy to turn a blind eye to what doesn’t satisfy our needs. Most people don’t want to know the devastating consequences of the fast fusion industry, all they want is the happiness they feel while shopping with their friends and keeping up with the trends set by their favorite celebrities. Another issue that shocked me after watching this documentary was knowing how much plastic was used to make a dress that was supposedly made out of “wool”, knowing this I have shared this video with many of my friends and they were all as shocked as I was to find out the truth about the clothes they buy on a regular basis.

The short film “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” was not only very informative, but it was also really entertaining to watch. If I’m being honest, I felt slightly called out by some of the stuff that was brought up. I must admit that I’ve always enjoyed shopping and feel that fashion is something I feel passionately about. However, some of the topics brought up throughout this video really went to show how important it is that I make changes to the way I shop. One of the things Hasan Minhaj brought up that truly shocked me was when he pointed out that “The clothes in your suitcase are screwing up the planet more than the flight you put them on” due to the amount of emissions released during the process of creating clothing vs. when going on a flight. Due to the information we learned about last week on how bad flying is for the planet, it really disappoints me to realize the damage I contribute by shopping as much as I do. When I buy a piece of clothing, I really don’t stop to consider what has been done to the planet in the process of creating it, but I should, and from now on, I will. Another thing I can aim to do more of is buy second hand clothing instead. I can still satisfy my love for fashion by doing so, and at the same time will be making less of an impact on our planet.

<p>
The video “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” takes on the problems of fast fashion from a satirical, humorous yet informative approach. I think I was definitely not the only person being deceived by the “ugly truth of Fast Fashion” and all the “annual reports” being made up. Imagine all these water, wood and oil being squandered and wasted just to supply our greed, while these valuable resources are much better off used for greater causes or being preserved. Also how ironic that we live in a world where the fashion industry uses millions of gallons of water just for clothing production, while hundreds of thousands of children do not have access to clean water. Plus, these water were only used to produce the fabric of clothes, and it doesn’t include any other manufacturing process. Meanwhile, think about all the oil being used to produce these clothes. I like his satirical comment to “drip”, because you surely are putting all solid drips of fossil fuel on your body. On top of that, imagine all the natural habitats being destroyed and the environment we polluted so that we can look better or feel better for ourselves. It is the equivalence of wearing leopard skin clothes without actually actually wearing them --- we are still killing the living and the non-living in our pursuit of “fashion”. I believe it is a natural thing to follow the fashion trend, but this toxic fashion culture is absolutely intolerable.
<br><br>

So maybe next time when you look into your closet full of clothes thinking “I don’t have anything to wear”, YES YOU DO.

The Patriot Act episode, "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" exposed the environmental horrors of the fast fashion industry by specifically calling out the false advertising, use of sweatshop labor, and lack of overall sustainability exhibited by brands such as Zara or H&M. I personally felt guilty while watching the video because for the longest time Zara has been one of my favorite stores to shop at. I fell victim to purchasing clothes from Zara's  "Join Life" label because I believed the clothes I was buying were really made from recycled or more ecologically sourced materials and wanted to support the steps the brand was taking in the right direction. Little did I know, as exposed by Hasan Minhaj, the only "recycled" part of each item was the tag.

<br><br>

Greenwashing is becoming an increasingly prevalent issue within a myriad of industries but is especially prominent in the fashion industry. From brands claiming to "remove a pound of trash from the ocean with every purchase" to making products from "recycled materials," companies are treating environmental awareness as a trend to sell more items. 
<br><br>


My biggest takeaway from this Patriot Act episode was to read carefully and do the research on a brand or item before purchasing instead of just trusting vague labels or advertisements. In my opinion, it's far better to buy a single staple item of clothing for a higher price that will last for years, isn't produced with sweatshop labor, and has a detailed list of materials from brands such as American Apparel or Reformation opposed to buying multiple cheap, single-use tops from a fast fashion store such as Forever 21.

I agree that Hassan is very talented in getting our attention with comedy and then explaining the real problem to us. I myself have never bought much clothing so I don’t believe I really contribute to the problem in this way but the stats he presented about it really struck a chord and made me feel terrible and want to help and spread the word. I know a lot of my friends and family have work to do when it comes to this subject so I will try to help.

In terms of clothing, I see myself as a decently responsible shopper. I have stopped shopping from fast fashion chains like Forever 21, frequently visit thrift stores and websites, and donate or sell my clothes when I’m done with them. Although I thought I was aware of the issues with fast fashion, this film showed a whole new side to me. The footage from the Rana Plaza disaster and the account of young female workers being beaten was heartbreaking. It is awful to see that companies, and therefore consumers, are putting people's lives at risk for their own profit. Despite the fact that being a wasteful consumer of clothing is environmentally unfriendly, I never considered that buying fast fashion as a humanitarian issue. Unlike other environmental issues, this is not a double edged sword. By prioritizing the environment, we are also helping the working conditions for those that work in the industry. Although I don’t believe that it is possible for everyone to say no to the cheap prices of fast fashion, this film taught me that people need to be thoughtful of where their items are coming from.

“The True Cost” made me remember the sad and inhumane aspects of the fast-fashion culture and industry. I’ve seen documentaries and videos about the fashion industry before, but I always end up forgetting about them, and continuing on with my shopping habits and lifestyle. The part of the film which gave detail and interviewed people involved with the garment factory collapse in Bangladesh made me feel sad and guilty about the way our clothes are made - and how most of us really don’t know or care until we see scenes like that, and understand the reality of the working conditions in most garment factories overseas. I find it strange how the dominant narrative has become “the working conditions and pay are good compared to their alternatives”. The fact that it could be worse does not justify poor and dangerous (sometimes life threatening!) working conditions. It’s sad how in America and other developed countries we are proud of the fact our clothes have become cheap, when really, they are cheap due to how companies have managed the exploitation of workers. Honestly, the more I think about it, the concept of fast fashion is so unnecessary and wasteful. Clothing doesn’t need to “go out of style”. We shouldn’t buy clothes just to throw them away. We should focus on buying quality items, that were produced in humane working conditions, that will last more than a season.

The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion was a captivating video that draws the audience in through the shocking truth of the fashion industry as well as the host’s use of humor. It’s shocking to hear how many companies reap the benefits from fast fashion without regard to the planet or the people they are harming in the process. It’s crazy that Zara’s founder, Amancio Ortega, who utilizes the fast fashion model is the 7th richest person in the world, worth $70 billion. All thanks to abusing the planet and people. It is truly alarming that there are 52 seasons for fast fashion companies. I was in utter disbelief when the host mentioned that H&M receives new shipments of clothing every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday. I found the H&M and Zara pop-up shop to be extremely interesting, especially when he brought out a model to show the products used in the making of a particular garment and how companies often want us to believe they are eco-friendly by labeling their clothes with vague words such as “sustainable”. I think using humor was an effective way of getting people to understand the negative impacts and the serious problem we face in the fashion industry.

I am horrified by the industries that prioritize shareholder value before peoples lives. Clearly shown in this documentary, factory owners will turn a blind eye to poor treatment of workers, inhumane working conditions, or safety hazards in order to fulfill an order for production. I can say that I figured conditions for laborers were bad, however, Indian fashion companies show to have terrible environments. In the collapses of the factories, I had to not look at the screen because I was so disturbed. I am disturbed by my participation in this because if I continue to buy into the industries that foster these conditions, then they continue in the cycle. I was equally disturbed by the ecological narcotics which cause birth defects, mental retardation, and physical handicapped effects. The farming suicides were saddening, I was so unaware of the political sides of this in foreign countries.

Since I’ve already watched the documentary “The True Cost”, most of what was mentioned in the talk show was things I knew. However, “The Ugly Cost of Fashion” was really engaging to watch, the host presented clips and statistics in an easy-to-follow way that while viewers could laugh along with him, they could also learn about true and informative facts.
<br><br>
It is mind blowing to hear that there are 52 seasons per year for the fast fashion industry, which approximately equals a new season every week. Despite how much money was spent on clothing and accessories we might only wear once or twice in the year, the production and aftermath of these items is the most worrisome concern we need to realize. 
<br><br>
One solution the host Hasan mentioned that could help reduce the harm we could cause to both the environment and ourselves is that wear your clothing for 9 months longer, it can reduce the carbon footprint for that garment by 30%, buy one recycled item, it would take half a million cars off the road.

After last week's focus on the effects that materialism has had on us "The True Cost" showed how materialism has affected developing countries like Bangladesh and Haiti who suffer first hand with the backdrops that materialism has had on the world. After watching the film, my biggest focus was on how the people in these developing countries are affected by their health and are forced to deal with the repercussions along with having to give up the little that they earn to treat these health issues. Also, these effects on the people have led them to have to be into a form of modern slavery. After this week's movie, I believe the best way to inform the public is to flat out show them just how much materialism is hurting our world. For instance, I think that the best way for us to grow and learn is by using social media to our advantage.

As a Chinese international student, I am aware of the difficulties that the factories workers. China’s GDP is increasing at a rapid speed and people’s living standard is unquestionably growing, but there are still many basic workers and people that are struggling for living, not to mention decades ago. As being the “factory of the world”, China had produced most of the products for the world years ago, even now. Because of its cheep labor force, many multinational companies have set their factories in China. Although they earn huge profit annually, only few percent of it if given to the factories workers. Maybe not as extreme as 3 dollars a day, the daily wage of garment workers in India mentions in the documentary, millions of workers are working the hardest job to get the basic salaries. I saw many news that workers suicided because of the huge pressure and pain put on them by their jobs when I was young. 
<br><br>

It is so unfair to both our environment and the workers. The film points out that garment industry is the second largest contaminating industry in the world. Billions of workers are producing clothings that might be worth equal to their monthly, even annually salaries, the wealthy people might just buy them because they like them at that moment. They might just wear the clothing one time, even zero, and put them back in their closet for the its entire life. Its is absolutely environmental disastrous. Due to the large production, China is suffering from the air pollution. Millions people are dying annually because of disease and illness relative to respiration. Also, the greenhouse gas emitted during the productions are causing catastrophic natural disasters globally. Isn’t it sad that we are killing ourself but gain nothing from our actions? 
<br><br>

We need to change our attitude and opinion on consumption and production. Although the production starts to shift to Southeast Asia because of the increasing cost of labor in China, billions of factories workers are still struggling and the pollution is increasing. We need to reduce our consumption in order to reduce and eliminate wast and pollution. Meanwhile, its is necessary and important that companies should increase the salaries of the factories workers. It is unjust and inhuman to exploit the basic workers because they are vulnerable group.

All throughout my life I haven't really considered where my clothes come from. I know I go to stores and I purchase them and see tags such as ; made in China, Made in Bangladesh, etc, but I never stopped to question where this jacket was made truly. When I started watching the film “The True Cost” I was utterly surprised. I grew up with all the made in other countries on my clothes but learned that up until the 1960s 95% of the clothes in America were made in America. Now that number has fallen drastically to 3%. This major drop is awful for multiple reasons. First is the fact that the clothing creation industry was outsourced to third world countries where it is cheaper for big corporations than in America. It's cheaper because they pay the workers little to nothing and the working conditions are utterly atrocious. The clothing industry is a sad place and most likely there won't be any change due to major profit margins.

Now that I know all that I do will try to change my habits when it comes to clothing shopping.

When I buy an item, I do not usually think about how it was manufactured. I see an item. I decide whether I want that item. I check to see if I have enough money if I do want that item. I buy the item. However, I definitely will change this process to be more mindful of my spending and where I buy items after watching the film The True Cost. I was appalled to see the horrific work conditions that those in third-world countries have to face on a daily basis just to support the fast fashion industry of Americans. It proves how destructive this industry is not only to the environment, but to human beings. However, people usually, and wrongfully, turn a blind eye to these situations because they do not want to change their way of living. To them, this situation is something that is relevant, but distant. Therefore, they do not realize their negative contributions. It is devastating to know that this nation is taking advantage of our privilege as Americans by mindlessly outsourcing our labor to those in third-world countries.

Many of us in this class will say that we are shocked, devastated, and angered at the fast fashion industry after watching either “The True Cost” or Hisan Minhaj’s episode on Fast Fashion, but will continue to give our money to companies like H&M and Zara because once again, it seems like a far off problem from us in the U.S. The videos of all those who died in the rubble of the collapsed clothing factory and direct comments of those who work in sweatshops are incredibly hard to watch. Thousands of lives and families are negatively affected in places like Bangladesh and India because Americans want more cheap, trendy clothes. Right now, having these images in our recent memory, it is easy to criticize American egotism and consumerism, but it is also so easy to fall back into old habits and continue to shop from fast fashion retailers because they are literally everywhere. Gap, Topshop, Cotton On, Brandy Melville and other popular brands take over malls and city streets. All that we see are the final products styled on mannequins through display windows, and we will forget soon enough where they came from and the struggling lives of the people that made them. 
<br><br>
Not only do sweatshop workers suffer, but thousands of cotton farmers in India are affected as well. Every 30 minutes, a farmer in India commits suicide because they are in debt to Monsanto and their land is taken from them. The worst part is that Monsanto is also American, and it is sickening that American consumerism and overpowering corporations are responsible for so much hardship and devastation in less economically developed countries. However, we will never directly see these challenges that we have created, and because of this it might be decades before any great change happens in the fashion industry. As far as I am concerned, I will hold myself accountable and not feed my money into the fast fashion industry, because no, a $4 plain crop tee I’d wear three times is not worth the lives of thousands. And no, I do not need a new cotton sweater at the price of what could have been 24 years of water supply to someone in need. 
<br><br>
I know I have mainly focused on the human impact of fast fashion, but the environmental impact is not overlooked. For the fashion industry to be the second behind oil in highest CO2 emissions is irresponsible. Although clothing is expressive and enjoyable and fun, it is also such a temporary part of life that is forever affecting the health of our earth.

“ The Ugly Cost of Fashion” had truly brought my attention the to the real and ugly truth of fast fashion. The fashion industry has created new trends of every week of the year and creating 52 seasons. they advertise these trends to people and create a high demand and to cover for that, large companies such as Forever 21 and H&M turn to third world countries to make their clothes. In order to receive business from these businesses, these countries basically give away the rights of their people and all safety measures to ensure the safety of their employees. One example of this is the disaster of Rhana Plaza. The entire building had collapsed killing over 1000 workers but the workers had already told their employers of the cracks in the building but they did not care. In this one incident out of many around the world 1000 had people lost their life all in the name of fast fashion. People who buy clothes from anywhere don’t know where their clothes is made, and if they were find out what type of conditions the workers are working in, they would not support these huge companies. 
<br><br>

Along with unethical working conditions these poor people work under, the clothing created is terrible for the environment. Clothes is sold at such a cheap price that people purchase them and dispose of them so quickly. Cheap clothing that’s disposed of just ends up in landfills for 200 years or shipped off to third world countries such as Haiti. We must try to minimize how much clothes we buy and stay away from huge fast fashion companies. In the video they say these designers and clothing companies would not have jobs if it weren’t for the consumer so we do have the power to create change.

I am the most gullible person when it comes to swiping my card. I will buy anything as long as I can make use of it for two minutes, even if I know I’ll never use it again. This temporary happiness has probably cost me thousands of dollars throughout the course of my life, but I never once saw it a problem with it. I mean, its my money, why can’t I spend it on what I wanted? If I wanted to buy 12 different swimsuits even though I can’t swim (which I have done on multiple occasions) I would without hesitation because it is what I want. Consumerism has completely engulfed my life, and after watching The True Cost, it really put into perspective how stupid I am to give my money to corporations just because they are having a sale or offering free shipping.
<br><br>

 A couple days ago, I got a record-breaking five packages in one day. I didn’t even know what they were because I had ordered so much that it was a complete surprise when I opened them. It turns out that 3 out of 5 were orders from fast fashion companies. That is where I usually shop, because I’m cheap and don’t care about quality as long as it doesn’t cost more than a few dollars. It really angers me how blind I am to these inhumane corporations simply because I’d rather buy a $5 shirt instead of $10. They literally do not care at all as long as they make money off of it. Women are being beat, paid an unlivable wage for inhumane work, and killed because they couldn’t care less about the well-being of the people who are the ones making their money. For example, I didn’t even know about the collapsing warehouses in Bangladesh that killed almost 1000 people because that is not what the news cares about. The news cares about the fact that Kylie Jenner’s kid has a peanut allergy, or that the Billie Eillish wore a new jacket walking down the street. The priorities of our world are so insane that no one can even process what is happening today. Something needs to change. More people cannot die.

I fortunately was able to see this movie a while back in my environmental science class in high school. A very inspirational documentary explaining the devestation that is occurring in these developing countries. I considerably remember the fact how the US was exploiting undeveloped countries for their availability and using them just to make more money. We need to realize that when we are purchasing items of clothing that it is not the actual environmental price as it was made to be. Reminds me of how the carbon tax works but it would not be to exciting for the consumer. But it is an ugly truth that needs to be reminded to the public. I liked how they brought up the tragic incident behind the Rana Plaza. Those underrepresented workers warned the owners about their poor working conditions. But still with no help, unfortunately 1000 workers were killed due to the building collapsing. People’s lives were lost and could have easily been prevented but they only cared about themselves. Instead they just lost even more money with their factory being destroyed.

Regardless of whether the fashion industry and high demand of new stuff has detrimental effects on the environment or not, this is not okay. I already knew about sweatshops and how they had terrible conditions, but I never really thought deeply about it; my theory (as terrible as this sounds) was out of sight out of mind. I am really glad that I got the opportunity to be forced to see how terrible this situation is. It was extremely heart wrenching to see all those people crying, scared that their family members were crushed in the building. My heart breaks for all the people that have to go through that, and it makes me extremely unsettled to know that most of my clothes were produced that way. I don’t think that the environment is the main thing that should be driving us to consume less, I think it is seeing how these peoples’ conditions are. Yes, consuming less is better for the environment, and it will ultimately help us all; and it is a good idea to be able to think about the environment and want to save it. However, I think for an incident like this, we must think of those people first, and how they are living, and how WE are the ones that cause them to live like that. 

<br><br>

What breaks my heart even more is that the workers don’t even have the worst job for the ones that are available to them. I wish we could spend less of our money consuming new things for ourselves at the cost of real people, and instead focus our time, money, and efforts into helping people who struggle so much to make a living and risk their lives to support their families.

The film, “The True Cost,” was truly heartbreaking to watch. A lot of the films we’ve watched so far in the class have made me sentimental, but this film specifically really impacted me. At first, I just thought the film would be the typical movie about fast fashion and it’s impacts. I didn’t expect to hear testimonies about people being locked in sweatshops because they had demanded for some basic rights. Also, another scene that was unexpected was when people who were peacefully protesting for more rights were faced with brutality. When a Cambodian man got shot at and was laying on the floor, that’s when my emotions overcame me. It made me realize how naïve I am to be shopping without realizing the consequences my actions have on other people from different countries. Even though I don’t shop as impulsively as before, there have been times where I just buy stuff to treat myself. When I regretted my purchase, I always made myself feel better by saying I could just resell it or donate it. However, hearing that donating clothes doesn’t have a big, positive impact as we think made me realize how unaware I actually am. This film made me even more aware of negative impacts I wasn’t aware of in both economic and environmental aspects. Especially where these companies make us feel “rich” when we buy stuff, but in reality, we are becoming poorer due to these consumerism habits. I appreciate that this film focused more on the impact it has on individuals on top of the facts.

In “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” the Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj, one of the issues he brings up is greenwashing in the fashion industry. As environmental issues in the commercial world are brought to light, in many industries, not just the fashion industry, companies turn to greenwashing instead of making real changes. This frustrates me so much because many of us believe these companies when they use key words like “green”, “eco-friendly”, “sustainability”, and anything with “eco-“ before it. Not many people look much further than that to see if these products really are sustainably made. The fact that these companies would so blatantly lie and fool the public with terms like these make me furious. It’s so misleading and wrong, but so many big companies do it, not just H&M! For example, the whole plastic straw movement was supposed to bring awareness to the fact that ALL disposable plastics are bad, but companies call themselves “green” and “eco-friendly” for simply selling paper straws while they still use single-use disposable plastic for the bigger more wasteful items such as cups and so much more. 
<br><br>

Also, I like that Hasan Minhaj addresses a very general audience. You don’t have to have any prior environmental knowledge or knowledge of the fast fashion industry to learn something from watching his video. He also uses humor to ease the message along. He’s able to reach a broader audience through his use of humor. 
<br><br>

The craziest thing to me in this video was the fact that if everyone bought one used item of clothing instead of a new one this year, it could save nearly 6 lbs of CO2 emissions, which is equal to removing nearly half a million cars off the road for a year. That’s crazy! I have always liked thrift shopping, but I never realized how big of a positive impact buying used clothes had.

I saw that some students made the claim that they were glad to be broke university students. I personally feel the same. When Hasan showed a dress that was 4% wool then compared it to a dress made of sponges, I was in disbelief. When explaining the production of fast fashion fabrics, I was saddened. I knew the severity of fast fashion to an extent, but upon learning about the pulping of trees, I was unnerved. For most fast fashion brands being so cheap, it’s ironic that the cost of the cheap clothes is so heavy. I used to shop at H&M specifically for their “Conscious” line because I thought it made a difference. I’m glad to have shifted to buying things secondhand and using my items longer.

I watched both The True Cost and Ugly Cost of Fast Fashion and all I have to say is… I am sad. The Ugly Cost of Fast Fashion I think is a good video to catch people’s attention. It is a little more light-hearted yet still highlights the effect of fast fashion on third world countries. What really got me was The True Cost . I had no idea what the cost of my clothes were; not only did they cost me money, they also cost lives. The working conditions are absolutely horrendous, children are suffering from the side effects of chemicals leaking into their environment, men are killing themselves by drinking the pesticides, and the list goes on. And the sad part is that people are so disconnected from what they buy they don’t even give it a second chance. With all of the negatives, I do believe we are making strides towards highlighting the injustices. As a result, the more we talk about it, the more we target young children to be more consumer conscious, and the more our generation speaks out, I do think we will start to reverse the process of over consumption. We have the potential to be resourceful once again, it just may take a lot to get there.

After watching the video titled “The Ugly Cost of Fashion”, I was in awe of just how much fast fashion is impacting the environment. I was completely unaware of how much water and plastic is used to produce something so small like a single t-shirt. As I continue to watch the videos every week, I sadly feel worse about the decisions I make because the videos inform me of just how much a single person is able to damage the planet. This group of people damaging the planet includes myself in more categories than I thought. Ignorance really is bliss because I feel that the more I learn, the more responsible I am for my own actions and the actions of those that I know are partaking in lifestyles that continuously damage the planet. So many of the main contributors of “fast fashion” are places that I have personally bought many articles of clothing from and it makes me bummed to know that I have mindlessly been fueling their capitalist agendas without even knowing its impacts on the planet. What is even more angering is how the host of the show revealed that fast fashion companies will bend the truth when they attempt to promote clothing as “eco-friendly”. More specifically, I was left in shock when he revealed that the recycling symbol found on clothing tags just means that the tag itself is made from recycled material…not the clothing. I am sure that these fast fashion industries know what they are doing when they market something to seem like it is better for the earth than it actually is and it honestly makes me mad to know that they are manipulated the public just to make a quick buck. There is more on the line than money. Think about it, why worry about making millions of dollars when you’ll die because there is no planet left to inhabit?

The main idea is Corporations want the cheap price and good profit but not provide care for the workers, the people, that make everything possible. The fashion industry, the agriculture industry, every industry faces greedy men in back suits and that's awful.
<br><br>

One particular interviewee was Kate Ball-Young and her comments in regards to sweatshop workers. Young believes the worker's suffering is justified because it is not the worst thing these people could be doing and that it is a safe industry.....ok wow um.
<br><br>

Firstly, what are the worst things that they can be doing? What do you think constitutes worse? Are you talking about death? Is dying the worst thing they could be doing?
<br><br>

Second, is it a job like everyone else? A job? This is what you call a job? I'm pretty sure you don't have to worry about the building you work in collapsing Kate. I'm 100% sure you will not face going hungry once in the next few weeks. I am certain you don't have to worry about losing mobility in your limbs or outright losing limbs, having your child suffer mental or physical damage, I'm sure you can sleep at night comfortably knowing these sweatshop workers are not your equals. These human beings are forced into these positions to survive, to chose this work but that does not give you the right to take advantage of their situations and fuck them over and then sell them back the idea "well it could be worse". You reek of privilege. You do not have to worry of such things because you have a safety net; living in the US with social programs that grant aid is a privilege, your options are not starve and die

There is nothing dangerous about sewing? Have you ever had your finger cut off or had your hands become a mangled bloody mess? if not would you like to give sewing a try? You do realize the vast majority of injuries related to sewing are with the sewing needles right, you know the thingies your hands are very close to when sewing. If safe to you means, degradation working conditions, failing sewing machines, low pay (because low pay means low income and low income means unlivable conditions leading to death) then please reevaluate where you truly stand in this issue.
<br><br>

This is only what one industry has to say, unfortunately the agriculture industry is not any better. A monopoly on seeds? Are you kidding me? The fact that this has led to an increase in suicides committed by farmers just makes this whole situation 10 times more cruel.

"The True Cost" truly hit home for me as I, especially during my younger teen years, was someone who invested in brands like H&M and Zara, I remember being so excited to find a good deal, I felt a though I could buy so much more, because it was cheaper. This kind of mentality is exactly the reason why these fast fashion industries exist. It becomes a cycle of how much more can you produce for the least amount of cost. As we saw in the film, the behind the scenes of this fast fashion world is something truly horrific. Often times we don't correlate our new funky boots, to the crammed, abused workers, working 10$ a month to make our clothes. Seeing the pain and struggle behind these women who have children to feed and take care of, while being enslaved to the system was truly heart breaking. In the film, the workers were treated in a very inhuman way, being crammed into unsafe factories, without a voice to have say in their rights. It was so sad to see the chaos after the factory in Rana Plaza fell together and the families outside were searching for them, only to find out they were most likely dead.
<br><br>
I often see instagram models creating advertisements for brands such as "Fashion Nova", who's clothing is extremely cheap, and while it may once have fooled me it now makes me sad, and also makes me see how unaware many of these "influencers" are to what they are promoting. I feel like no amount of money offered for an advertisement should be worth destroying the lives of so many fast fashion workers by keeping them trapped in that industry.
<br><br>
It was inspiring to see the motive and determination of the founders and community of the People Tree, who are creating clothing in a moral, environmentally friendly way. They face tough competition against the fast fashion industries who sell their product for much cheaper, however are truly creating a path for more environmentally friendly industries to unfold. I now find something special in spending more on one thing - that is more environmental and people friendly, then buying a million things that are adding to the damage. I love that thrift shopping culture is hip again, and do see hope for the future.

I believe the idea of  consumerism is not all that bad. Stuff and things do provide some sort of happiness and joy or they would have ever existed in the first place and we would all just be living under a rock. The fault lies in the complete excess of consumer goods that they do have. My mom always told me that everything is fine in moderation, meaning if you do something, buy something, I don’t what else, but as long as it's within a reason. Now this part is where things get grey. Who is it to decide what is considered within reason, is it an individual perspective?or a state?government?the world? The correct answer in my opinion is the individual. We are able to influence others but a person will always make a choice not so much based on themselves but a choice that lies within their idea of what is the “correct” one to make (in their opinion), and sometimes for a person the “correct” choice and the selfish choice are very similar.

This film well integrates the social and environmental aspects of garment industry, vividly revealing the TRUE external costs of the seemingly cheap clothes we see every day, allowing us to be mindful of our purchasing behavior. The True Cost really broadens my horizon and reveals part of the world that I haven’t thought about. The garment industry is both so close to us and so far from us. It is close as we pick and wear them daily, and as they hang in beautiful shop windows whenever we pass the street besides our home. However, it is also far away from us as they were made in other countries where the manufacturing conditions may be out of our imagination. 
 <br><br>

The scene that shocks me the most is when Vandana in India talked about how farmers were forced by companies like Monsanto to end their life. The seed monopoly for sure provides companies huge profits, but those profits are generated from the blood of the poorest farmers in the world, and I wonder how those businessmen can feel true happiness when spending that profit for their better life. As Vandana said, “For the company, it’s win, win, win, and for nature and people, it’s lose, lose, lose.” Such external costs also reveal the huge inequality in world and the extreme selfishness of a section of human beings. 
 <br><br>

After realizing the huge external costs associated with garment industry, my view on the cheap and fashionable clothes that were once appealing to me was changed directly. I believe I will buy less, and whenever I need to buy, I will buy brands that are ethically and environmentally responsible. Besides change of consumer behavior, I believe corporations have the major responsibility. As a piece of news in the film shows: “Individuals are amoral. What we need to do is to change the way companies operate.” However, the film also explains how companies refuse government regulation with a major reason of free trade. There are surely a lot of difficulties present, and to mitigate the problem requires change from the supply to demand, from individual to international. However, with the issue in mind, the problem is at least raised and hopefully, solutions and changes will not be far away.

I love Hasan Minhaj and his work. I have followed him since his days at the Daily Show on Comedy Central. Comedy is a great way to get your message across. Some people, including me, find it easier to process information if you can keep them engaged with comedy. Laughter helps soften the blow from depressing information. I think that's why shows like Hasan's and Trevor Noah's tend to have higher ratings than CNN. It can be stressful learning about climate change from news networks.

It is sad that third world countries are exploited. I buy clothes becaue I like to feel good. Most of the time, it is never about the need unless I am going on a trip that has weather I am not used to. State Street is one of my favorite streets in Santa Barbara. There are clothing stores up and down that street and I usually buy something just because it looks nice. Watching this segment will make me second guess my purchases.

This week’s video, in particular, was something that really changed my perspective and changed the way in which I viewed how American’s have used capitalism to their benefit. I always knew that a company’s main goal was to make money and sell their product to consumers, however, I did not know how inhumane the fast fashion industry truly is and how it has major consequences on not only the environment, but the people who are forced to produce the clothing. 
 <br><br>

First off, the fact that the clothing industry is the second most environmentally polluting industry behind fossil fuels, is already a red flag. Seeing how the water sources in manufacturing cities in Bangladesh and Cambodia are being contaminated with pollution, leading to major disease epidemics and the deaths of many is something I was not aware of. It was heartbreaking to see how the people of Bangladesh and Cambodia are slaving away and being denied proper wages, labor laws, and working conditions just so that people in developed countries such as the United States could buy a $10 T-shirt that we will most likely only wear twice. From this documentary, we are able to see the effects that the fashion industry not only has on the environment, but the laborers who make it possible. Unfortunately, there is fault on both sides. Although these companies are producing at an alarming rate, there is also a pressing demand from the consumers who support the industry. Without demand, there is no supply. This shift society’s values and mindset of always wanting more is a major problem that was also discussed in this week’s reading, “The Waste Makers”. Maybe, there is more that we as a society can do in challenging the growth of such industries by assessing our own consumption and how we play a role in the cyclical trap of fast fashion. 
 <br><br>

Quite frankly, my main concern is the human rights that are being violated for the sake of “fashion”. This seems as though it is a crime against humanity, yet it is permitted and enforced by companies under the protection of free enterprise and capitalism. What really stood out to me was the fact that these people who disproportionately make up the labor force of the fashion industry are being oppressed by their own government when they try to stand up for themselves and demand better working conditions and wages. This to me is a never-ending cycle of oppression, exploitation, and profit. The fast fashion industry should have never gotten this far, and the fact that there are no regulations to prevent things like this from happening and to keep the companies in check, calls for a major reform in the system.

Having already seen the film “The True Cost,” I was not too surprised about the extreme wastefulness of fast fashion. However, I found the representational dress made of sponges to show the real amount of materials used in clothes surprising. I have never truly thought about what materials in clothing are or aren’t eco-friendly. For instance, I didn’t know that to make clothes a lot of water is used up. In addition, I was also surprised by where most of the donated clothes end up at. Whenever I bought clothes and ended up donating older clothes instead of throwing them away, I felt like I was being environmentally friendly. However, there are simply too many clothes for our population. Even too much for poorer countries that we think may need clothes to end up having too much that they burn it since it’s sent to them go deal with. Instead of just donating, people can buy less and buy only what they truly want and will enjoy wearing.

I feel that "The True Cost" is an extremely important documentary that every American (and people from other western countries) should see. Before watching, I knew that a majority of clothing sold in the U.S. probably came from some sweatshops in Bangladesh, Cambodia, etc., but apart from that, I didn't think much about it. It wasn't until that I sat through the entire movie that I was just blown away about how bad the conditions were and how these massive fast fashion corporations were extorting these people for their labor, all the while the American public is completely oblivious to what's going on. In many ways, it can be compared to slave labor since many of the workers are forced to work there since there are no other job opportunities available and thus they are forced to work there or otherwise they will starve to death. And since they are working there out of desperation, they have no leverage over working conditions or pay and as a result they work for $2 a day in infrastructure that is ready to collapse on them as such happened at Rana Plaza. This all happens while fashion addicted Americans run to these fast fashion stores to try and catch a week long trend for the small price of $10 a shirt. It really does make me sick to the stomach. The silver lining to all of this is that more people are becoming aware of this extortion and as a result, many fair trade businesses are popping up to help lift up these workers and treat and pay them fairly. For now on, I am going to ensure that whatever clothing (or any items in general) I buy is certifiably fair trade.

I think that the film did a pretty good job at communicating its subject although it could be even better if it included interviews of the U.S. customers. It used a lot of astonishing facts and figures to show us what a big impact that the fashion industry is having on our environment and the workers in those third-world countries. Before watching this film, I would never imagine that the fashion industry causes more pollution than any other industry but the oil industry. Also, the tragedy of the Rana Plaza is definitely touching for every single person who watched this film. We realized that thousands of people are seriously dying from making cheap clothes that we wear. However, I still believe that it’s better if the director added some interviews of the customers who actually buy a lot of cheap clothing. We saw video clips of crazy Black Friday shopping, but if one of those people could speak up, I assume that the film can be more effective.
  <br><br>
However, as a consumer who enjoys the benefits of living in capitalism, I felt ashamed after watching this film. My response is primarily intellectual, I think. My mom always complains to me that I have a ton of clothes and shoes that I barely wear. And it’s just like what the Youtubers said in the film: “I bought it because it’s cheap, and I don’t know if I really like it”. So, this film makes me have to re-think about my choice. Am I rational when I purchase the things from malls? I will be more careful about what I buy next time.
 <br><br>
 I learned a lot from this film. Mostly, I learned how crucial the fashion industry is affecting on every aspect. I knew ahead of time that the workers in countries like Bangladesh are making minimum wages, but I never thought that there’re so many accidents happening in those cheap factories taking away thousands of lives. And if we chase back to the cotton industry, all the seeds and pesticide companies are also killing thousands of people silently by polluting our land. This film changed my attitude that I will re-consider my choice before I buy those things that I may not necessarily need.

After watching "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion," it came as no surprise to me that companies like H&M are ignoring their environmentally catastrophic behaviors in the name of capitalizing off fashion trends. What makes this even worse is their streamlined distribution model: they vigorously design and ship pieces of clothing to areas all around the globe. With this rate of global shipping, it's easy to say that corporations like this are largely responsible for the immense degradation that we are inflicting on this planet. 
 <br><br>


Not only does this cause direct harm to the climate, but it also raises a large environmental justice issue. Workers that manufacture clothes that come from companies like H&M and Zara are paid dirt-cheap wages with terrible working conditions. Some may even draw comparisons between these facilities and the iPhone manufacturing plants in China, or even many Amazon locations in the United States. Doing this kind of harm to the planet while also keeping workers hostage in these conditions just goes to show how much reform needs to be done to these large corporations, and how their business models will eventually lead us to the end, literally.

“The True Cost” was the most impactful film that we have watched so far in this class to me. I was really saddened by all the horrible events that occurred in Bangladesh and Cambodia. The Rana Plaza disaster brought up many emotions of sadness and anger for me. Seeing all the family and friends of the victims standing outside waiting for their loved ones to be rescued was absolutely heart wrenching. Throughout the film I felt like I really wanted to do something to help these people. My automatic reaction was that I should first stop buying clothes from these fast fashion stores that employ sweatshop workers. But an important point was brought up during the film. Without these sweatshop jobs, the people would be working much worse jobs outside or possibly be unemployed. This made me feel very confused about what I am supposed to do to help these people. I thought what fair trade clothing companies like People Tree and Stella McCartney are doing is super great and they are companies that I would like to support. I also learned that most of the clothes that people donate don’t go to thrift shops, but actually go to landfills in places like Africa. Overall, I was really saddened by this film, and the film really wanted me to take action and change my negative consuming habits.

I felt the same way after watching the documentary, I was appalled by how the world uses and exploits third world countries to make their products. Fast fashion is not worth the horrendous working conditions that the people in Bangladesh and Cambodia have to endure. The tragedy of The Rana Plaza disaster is a perfect example of the injustice in the production of the fast fashion industry. I am happy that I do not contribute to fast fashion because I get a majority of my clothes from the thrift store and rarely buy new clothes unless I need them. I feel like that a lot of people do not realize the impact that clothing purchases has on the world and the environment. The amount of pollution attributed to the fashion industry goes over most people's heads, it is the second most polluting industry in the world. Fast fashion should be considered a taboo for people to be apart of because of all the negative ramifications it has on the environment.

"The True Cost" is heartbreaking. Watching the part where Bangladesh factory owner complaining Western clothing companies for absurdly low price on their products sticks my heart. Now I kind of feeling wearing clothes is a guilt. We should advocate for worker's safety and well-being.
 <br><br>

Moreover, we should look at what clothing industries reflect on the larger consumerism. Fast fashion is just one of the products of consumerism. It leads to oppression to workers in developing countries that Westerners outsourced their production line to. It also damaged nature and future generations by using pesticides. Company's monopoly in a chain of industries should be ashamed that they are gaining profit at the expense of other people's life. What's more, greenhouse gases produced in manufacturing process have major contribution to climate crisis. The solution is quite simple and is presented in the film, People Tree: a company “dedicated to the principles of fair trade, covering fair wages, good working conditions, transparency, environmental best practice and gender equality.” In fact, we should promote such concept so that both human right and environmental issues will be solved.

Though the subject matter of The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion was not a “happy” topic, I thoroughly enjoyed watching it as Hasan Minhaj mixed humor into the depressing facts of our consumer industry. I was amazed by the fact that the fashion industry produces 52 seasons a year and that the average American buys around 60 new items of clothes (not counting socks and underwear) a year. However, considering the fact that in order to sustain 52 seasons a year, in which one must assume that much of the clothes produced are wasted, a company would have to make clothes cheaply. This then allows consumers to buy more items as they are not weighed down by the cost of one specific item. Though this system may allow for variety within an one’s wardrobe, it is absolutely deleterious to the environment. After watching Minhaj’s comical video, I hope to avoid purchasing products from companies such as Zara and H&M and to actively try to lengthen my usage of the current items I own.

For this week’s video, I watched Hasan  Minhaj’s video. I am a huge fan of Hasan and could not help myself. The one thing I take from this video is the way corporations just take from major companies to make profit from ideas that are not even theirs. That is not even the most mind boggling thing, because if you see the amount of water used to make one article of clothing is crazy. Even with viscose that makes clothes and uses 33% made from threatened forests. Also, the idea of becoming mutants because children are living by factories and rivers is so bizarre because they are just neglecting the actual problem. As Hasan  mentions, many of us do not believe the problem is not because of us or does not apply to us, but really when we think we are doing good by donation to major thrift places, we are actually not because the unwanted clothes will still go to the trash. Also companies are so manipulative by having a recycling bucket at stores that gives people credit because they still buy more and end up throwing it away at some point and making even more trash. From H&M and Zara, those two are the most manipulative because they will even scam their way through their reports and we do not even notice or account for it. All in all, this fast fashion is really affecting a lot of major pollution in the world.

I was definitely surprised hearing that instead of 2 seasons in fashion there was 52 and even thinking about the working conditions present makes me shake. I feel America prides itself with wanting to produce everything here to promote jobs but clothes made being 97% made outside of the US is surprising. Then I think about statistics that make us be apart of a country that utilizes and takes for granted the working conditions that comes hand in hand with fast fashion. People make 3 dollars a day with horrifying working conditions but if that does not bring an end to fast fashion than the contributions of co2 released by fast fashion is terrifying. We fuel fast fashion because cheap and quick fashion is so effective that stoping that trend is nearly impossible and as much as I wish it was not, even I am guilty of the small pleasures of fast fashion. We as a country are taking advantage of so many different people that thinking about fuels a whole different type of anger. Knowing the damages fast fashion does to our environment is insane but even thinking about the additional negative effects present makes the whole fast fashion industry so shocking to even think that this is a 3 trillion dollar industry. After so much harm and negligence of the earth and the people in this industry it makes me want to tear it down. I want to tear myself off of fast fashion tendencies and become better.

"The Ugly Truth Of Fast Fashion" from Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj was a very interesting video. I had never seen the use of comedy to describe and explain the serious issues embedded in the ways of fast fashion but I found it to be very effective. It allows the audience to be more engaged in the information which in my opinion has more affect on the people who are watching. I not only found it entertaining but I also found it informational, I could not believe that so many people don't know what our products are really made of, learning about how much oil is used to produce certain things or how much water and land is used we almost scary. We never tend to focus on the process of something being made but really only focus on the end result, but this is how we have created such a disaster with consumerism. We need to learn to put things into perspective and do our part to save the planet. Even if its as small as keeping our clothes an extra 9 months or buying second hand.

I share much of the same sentiments you have about Hasan Minhaj's "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion." In my eyes, it was very easy to watch because Hasan knew exactly when to crack a few jokes to lighten up the mood and set the stage for the issue at hand while sprinkling in some facts here and there, but he then takes on a more serious tone for the latter half of the episode when exposing how H&M and Zara impact and influence the environment, the fashion industry, and our consumer society with their "sustainable" business models, whatever that's supposed to mean. Their meaningless marketing terms like "ecologically grown" and "sustainably produced polyurethane" remind me that a lot of companies are in the business of misleading their customers; it's exactly like how the food industry constantly scrambles to come up with new ways to reinvent the word "sugar" because it's something that scares a lot of people when they see it now, which is why we have terms like "dehydrated cane juice" (how is that legal?). Some industries, fast fashion included, simply don't want to be phased out despite their thousands of stores and factories contributing to a scarily large carbon footprint by, as both you and "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" mentioned, using thousands of liters of water and barrels of oil to produce that enticing $7 shirt. But like Hasan Minaj mentions, who is really going to sit down and comb through the hundreds of pages of an annual report for a clothing company like Zara to find discrepancies in their environmental initiatives? Hasan had a whole team do that so we didn't have to, but what about all of the other companies we're constantly buying stuff from? I understand Hasan's main takeaway that you brought up, how we should keep our clothes for longer and buy more used clothing in general, but is it really too much to ask companies to do less harm to the environment before I'm pondering and buying their "quality" end product to keep for as long as I can?

"The True Cost" was a film I found myself very angry and frustrated watching, because it highlighted the abuse and exploitation of workers who manufacture the clothes we consume so mindlessly and recklessly. Companies are allowed to exploit workers in developing countries and make their working conditions as hazardous as they want for as little pay as they want because they don't have to obey the same labor laws in America and it even makes them more profit, as if they need anymore money. It's sickening to see how much the poor are taken advantage of globally, and it's even more sickening that I find myself powerless in this situation as there isn't really much I can do as an individual to fix this. Even if I consume less, that's not going to stop workers from being so exploited. And it's not even just limited to developing countries. I read an article a while ago about how the very popular brand Fashion Nova is running what resembles sweatshops right here in Los Angeles. The Labor Department is currently investigating them because on average employees would earn as little as $4.66 an hour and had to work in dirty factories with rats, cockroaches, and more. Even worse, they pay their social media celebrity influencers buckets of money to promote their brand but they can't even pay the people that make their clothes a mere minimum wage let alone a livable one. Ultimately, the film spoke to the disturbing exploitation that occurs to help fuel consumerism. It made me realize the importance of being aware as consumers as we can't mindlessly consume goods that are ruining the environment and made through severe exploitation.

Having watched both “The True Cost” and “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” before this course I was glad to see that we were going to be discussing the seriously harmful effects of the fast fashion industry. It is so easy to ignore all of the problematic things that are associated with fast fashion which is why it is so important that more people are informed about these problems. Factory workers who make all of the fast fashion products that we so thoughtlessly consume are being faced with inhumane working conditions that are costing people their lives. Along with this we are also killing the planet with the emissions that are produced when these massive amounts of clothes are made and shipped. 

 <br><br>

The “American Dream” is so dangerous because it encourages people to spend with reckless abandon as a “reward” for hard work. People think that buying that expensive new jacket or hand bag is a sign of success but it is really just the result of unfair labor and a large amount of emissions. While no one can avoid consuming clothes completely it is worth looking into brands that are honestly sustainable and paying a visit to a thrift store. These days they even have online thrift stores that give people the sense of online shopping while being a bit more conscious about their consumption. Of course online shopping in itself is an issue because of shipping, but this online thrift store is still a better alternative to online shopping for fast fashion. 
 <br><br>


It is often asked whether our obsession with things is due to the corporations or the consumers, and while I believe it is mainly the corporations, I also think that this does not necessarily matter. When there is a problem it is less effective to spend time debating who is at fault than spending time actually working to solve the issue. Both corporations and consumers need to take a step back and consider their environmental impact. This all being said, I also think that our best chance of solving this particular issue does involve more change on the consumer’s end. It is more likely that consumers will change their ways than the massive fast fashion corporations that only focus on their income. 

 <br><br>

In the video lecture Ken asked if we should be delivering the message about fast fashion in the manner of a documentary, like “The True Cost,” or if we should take a comedic route, like “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion.” I believe that the ideal situation would be to have both represented with most issues because this will reach a wider net. Many people who watch Patriot Act may know Hassan Minhaj from his stand up comedy and may not be the same audience that looks to watch a serious documentary when browsing on Netflix. Maximizing the number of people who are aware of the issues facing our planet is an incredibly positive goal that is best achieved through the maximizing of content available on those issues. The only possible issue that may arise is the attempted delegitimization of the topic by climate deniers  because of the comedy standpoint that is taken, but this is still no reason to avoid this method.

"The Ugly Truth Of Fast Fashion" was my favorite video I have watched so far this quarter! The speaker made it very funny and relatable which made it very entertaining to watch but also very educational.I like this video because its something that everyone could watch and not get bored.  Finding out that every week is basically a new season in the fashion industry shocks me, I guess that's why they call it "fast" fashion. Another fact that blew my mind is that it takes 10330 liters or 24 years of drinking water for one person, to make a single jacket. I think its super lame that some companies can mark clothing as recycled on the price tag when it's really only the materials in the tag that is recycled. Thats really unfair to the consumer and I feel like there should be more laws surrounding that issue. I did find it hard to believe that the average American throws away 80 lbs of clothes every year? 80 lbs seems like it would be such a large amount of clothing pieces. I'm curious if that number is accurate because even though there are many people with lots of clothes, there are also many people in poverty who wouldn't throw away that much clothes in a single year. A new term I learned in this video is "green washing", this intrigued me because how is it legal to advertise something that isn't true? Shouldn't companies have to give full details? This guy did a great job of sharing important facts with his audience and keeping them engaged.

This film has shown me the other side of fast fashion. It was truly heartbreaking to see how much these people suffer every day to produce clothes that people throw away after just recently buying them. The videos from YouTube that were used in the movie demonstrated what kind of culture and content is required today by the viewers. And this makes me think: if people actually knew where all their clothes were coming from and what kind of suffering those who produce them have to go through, would they still watch such videos and buy these clothes almost every day or stop their mindless consumption? 
 <br><br>
Maybe the main problem about this issue, which is arguably one of the most important parts of climate change, is the negligence of both the consumers and the producers. From the consumer’s perspective, it is the negligence about the production, and from producers’ – negligence about the way of living of these people who risk their lives every day. In my opinion, the producers’ side is much more cruel than the consumers’, because the producers simply don’t want to change their way of making money, even if it involves killing real people and order to make the most profit. It is really sad.

In “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion”, Hasan Minhaj talks about excessive clothing consumption in developed countries as a result of the fast fashion industry, and the ethical and environmental issues associated with it. Even though the episode is short compared to the film “The True Cost”, the key problems that have occurred because of fast fashion are noted. With the way that the information is presented, especially the humor in between every devastating fact, this seems like a better way to bring awareness to the average person as it is more digestible and captivating rather than strictly informative.
 <br><br>
The latter part of his segment about greenwashing was very insightful because these fast fashion companies are able to, legally, deceive consumers into thinking that they are making more environmentally conscious decisions. When claims like “sustainable” or “made of recycled material” are made, even I, who does not support fast fashion, tend to think more positively about these companies. So all this does is help boost their public image and potentially their sales, as some people may feel reassured to buy the clothing that is marketed as being for a good cause and contributing less to the environment. Also, the part about H&M’s recycling program in which the clothing is not actually being reused, again, shows that seemingly eco-conscious actions only serve to deceive consumers. Not only that, but it is ridiculous how they even offer a discount code to people who donate old clothing. This only promotes the idea that people should toss out their old items in favor of new ones, which aligns with their goal of getting consumers to buy all of their newest fashions. In turn, these efforts that appear, from the consumer’s perspective, to help the environment are only further destroying it.

In the documentary The True Cost, I was absolutely disgusted and horrified about what the fashion industry is doing in other countries and what they are allowing. They force factories in places like Bangladesh to follow their demands so that they can keep their “52 Seasons of Fashion” so much so that they will even threaten the owners of them saying that they will withdraw their business. If the industry were to do that then hundreds of people will lose their jobs and then be left with not a lot of options. This business practice of the fashion industries has even made the management of different companies to impose harsh standards and rules on the people they employ and has even led to the deaths of hundreds of people because of these standards. The other thing that these fashion industries will argue is how these “fair jobs” are the “best” options these people can get in their area but that does not mean that they should be treated like they are beneath us.

<p>

1) Was the film effective at communicating it subject? If so, how did it achieve this?
 <br><br>
Yes, I believe that the film does effectively communicate. The film begins with interesting but really basic topic in order to successfully draws audiences attentions while not making people feel the pressure of this heavy topic so that people will continue watching. Additionally, the director uses a ton of evidences including authoritative interviews and real life examples to prove himself right. Moreover, those real life evidences with accurate number of death and the analysis of the reasons behind those death logically shock people so that people can really be serious with what this documentary video is trying to tell us. Then people will try to change their attitudes and people around them’s attitudes deep from heart.
 <br><br>

2) Who do you think might be the film’s audience? People already concerned about the issue or casual viewers?
 <br><br>
From my perspective, casual viewers should be the audience of this film. From overall picture, this documentary video uses a lot of cut advertisements of fast fashion brand such as H&M and ZARA contrasting with interviews of miserable people in different languages and pictures of injured, poisoned,or dead to wake people’s emotions strongly, which is the basic strategy of appealing to emotions applying to casual viewers. Take the example of poisoned skinning kids lying on the beds with their mothers on the side for instance, seeing the mothers cry makes people sympathize, since they are attached to their families too.
 <br><br>

3) What was your general reaction to the film? Was your response primarily intellectual or emotional? In other words, how did the film make you feel? What did it cause you to think about?
 <br><br>
My general reaction was emotionally touched but also rationally cogitate at the same time. My emotion is generally because of the strategy it uses to appeal to emotion. But I’m also thinking rationally because the film brought up a view “Global market place is where we hope work to happen in whatever conditions we want and then the products come back to us and are cheap enough to throw away without thinking about it”  and people are suffered because of those companies. But objectively speaking, those companies only provide opportunities to work and those workers do have a choice no matter what their conditions are. People are born unequally and people always care about their self-interests no matter poor or wealthy so that it is really unfair to blame those brands “inhuman companies”. They only just don’t want to do more. From my opinion, the true cost should be the environmental damages that so far have caused because people only care about empty numbers like GDP. GDP is indeed truly important for countries and their development but countries only exist for a small period of time comparing to the age of the Earth, so to say, it is less important.
 <br><br>

4) Did you learn anything new from the film? If so, what? Did the film change your attitudes in anyway? If so, how? After watching it, did you feel optimistic or pessimistic?
 <br><br>
Yes, I do learn a lot from the film. I truly understand how big “the butterfly effect” can be. people never pay attention to chain business like fashion and never questioned how influential it can be. It inspires me to explode more hiding dark side of many seeming unrelated business. And honestly I neither feel optimistic or pessimistic, because it didn’t really changed my attitude, since the plante Earth is still spinning around and the business still needs to get going. But people including me should realize that we should do more when our time come, that is to say, to help more people.

The film, "The True Cost", was pretty impactful for me because it opened my eyes to how many underprivileged people live their lives regarding clothing. I feel like people joke about how people in under-developed countries make their clothes, but I've never really thought about the situation revolving around this. Mass consumerism is, of course, very bad for the environment, but it also creates a bigger demand for these poorly-treated fast fashion workers. The working conditions of these places are unbelievable, but do these people really have a choice? I mean, even the government isn't on their side; they refused to increase their wages just to be in good favor of the retail companies. These places don't have enough resources to create worker unions or anything similar. 
 <br><br>

The fact that the average American buys 68 pieces of clothing every year is pretty shocking. On top of the fact that America also only produces 3% of its clothes domestically, it shows why this situation exists. As a much bigger, wealthier country, we should be giving more resource to workers like these. Otherwise, we are just taking advantage of them.




</p><hr>


<p>

You never really consider what went into everything you buy at the store. The True Cost highlights the effects of the clothing industry across the world, and who suffers to keep up with America's high demand to stay in the highest fashion. The demand kills people, literally. There are laborers who strike for something that might even resemble a living wage, but get beat for doing so. There are sweatshop accidents, building collapses, and many more consequences of unsafe working conditions and unfair wages that result in literally thousands of deaths around the world so LA can have their Gucci bags and we can have our umpteenth pair of pants. The poor not only contribute very little to the climate change problem in general, but they suffer the worse from the rest of the world's gross consumption.

 <br><br>

 From what I saw in The True Cost, the clothing industry nears slavery. A few dollars a day, poor air, poor water, long grueling hours, getting beat by their managers, chemicals as a byproduct everywhere, god knows what else, are inhuman conditions and should be treated as crimes against humanity. It is hard to believe that kind of labor is what made my sneakers and near everything else I own. It is revolting so many suffer to appease gross consumption demands.

I guess it's bad to say you have a favorite aspect of climate change.  But if I were allowed to, my favorite would be the fast fashion industry.  It is the perfect example of how our relentless trivial gluttony is annihilating our habitat.  It is ridiculous how glaring the issue is compared to how little action is being taken to draw attention to it much less stop it.  I've seen a few episodes of the Patriot Act with Hassan Minhaj before but this one immediately grabbed my attention.  It is so abundantly clear that virtually every step of the fast fashion industry is despicable.  Some of these things have nothing to do with the climate crisis but are simply issues of massive human mistreatment.  Before anything is even sold in the United States it is manufactured for abysmally low fees by people who are being effectively worked to death for our clothing.  This is on top of the tonnes of carbon the industry contributes to the atmosphere, the corruption of the earth for natural materials and the debris created when destroying our discarded garments.  The worst part about this is that there is no justifiable reason for it.  There is no reason at all too keep accumulating and cycling 'stuff'.  No other society on the planet before this has cycled through more than 60 new garments a year.  It is ridiculous, it is our fault and it is inescapable.  The way to end these industries is to boycott them, show disgust to the big companies that had the gall to be irresponsible and money hungry.

At the beginning of the movie “The Ugly Truth Of Fast Fashion”, one sentence struck me deeply: “As recently as the 1960s, we were still making 95% of our clothes. Today, we merely making 3% and the other 97% is outsourced to developing countries around the world.” Why U.S is willing to import the clothes instead of producing it by themselves to create more job opportunity? 
 <br><br>

The reason is profit maximization. U.S, a developed country with the advanced technology, the labor cost is certainly very high, which is in inconformity with the idea of profit maximization. Meanwhile, with the new concept of “Fast Fashion”: almost overnight, transforming the way clothing is bought and sold, something new will come in every week with low and affordable price. To reach the target, companies have to produce the clothes in the developing countries, places where the labour costs and other costs are pretty lower than developed countries. In addition, those big clothes companies can squeeze the price as well since there are many small companies compete for those projects; thus, they can exert pressure on those small companies to obtain a satisfiable cost to reach a high profit. Nevertheless, those small companies want to make profits as well. How could this happen? They exert pressure on their labour to reach their target. For instance, those developing countries may ignore the requests of minimal wage, employ the child labor and provides an unsafe working condition to reduce the costs. And here comes the results: eight-story building collapsed near the capital of Dhaka, killing more than 70 people and a lot of clothes in America’s stores produced in Bangladesh via workers who earn 2$ a day. Although the bad results are obvious, the most upset thing is nothing will change! Those poor people will still work in the terrible working conditions with meager incomes. It is a vicious circle since if they choose to not work for those companies, they will not have incomes to raise their family. Meanwhile, it is also hard for those small companies to raise the working conditions or enhance the salary since once they do those things, they will raise up their cost which may well reduce their competitive ability comparing to other countries. The Fast Fashion provides job opportunities towards those developing countries in one side, but causes the exploitation of working force in other sides! To address the problem, we need to come up some ways to balance it.

From the film "The True Cost": [Richard] “If you don’t change the system, you’re leaving intact the decision-making of these enterprises, which means a small group of executives and shareholders are going to be working in the same system, subject to the same pattern of rewards and punishments, which will sooner or later make them reimpose, there or elsewhere, the very conditions you're fighting against. So stop this stuff about improving their conditions, deal with the system, or else you're not serious.”
 <br><br>

Let me emphasize that again: “ So stop this stuff about improving their conditions, deal with the system, or else you're not serious.”
 <br><br>

By this point in the film I was already angry at the those in charge of creating a system that relies on the cheap labor of individuals in places like Bangladesh. This quote made me focus my anger onto one solution: we must tackle the fast fashion system that values capital over the lives of people. “...deal with the system, or else you’re not serious.” While I find this quote to be motivating to get up off my butt and take action towards dismantling the fast fashion industry, I also find it to be scary in the sense that I have never tried to take down a system as big as fast fashion before. Besides not shopping at major retailing stores that support the cheap labor that is happening in places like Bangladesh, what other action can I take to, as Richard states, “deal with the system”? Do I send this movie via email to places like Forever 21, H&M, etc.? Do I send these same companies your youtube channel? What other other ways are there to actually change things? Thoughts anyone?



</p><hr>


<p>
Personally, I've already done tons of research into the fast fashion industry and it's effects on the environment and the people working in it. It is always emotional to see how little these huge businesses care about their surroundings or the working environments of their workers. However, “The True Cost” allowed me the chance to try and develop my own solutions to this enormous problematic industry. It made me think about the way I currently live, and how the choices that I make affect the environment on a relatively large scale, and ways I can lower my impact on the world's ecosystems. I already knew that Fast Fashion provided terrible work conditions for their workers, but I didn’t how bad they were actually treated. People in this industry are literally dying because of the environment these companies have provided them to work in. The Rana Plaza incident, for example, the Bangladesh Rana Plaza Incident where thousands died in a building that contained five garment factories because of how badly they kept up with the buildings’ conditions. We can't allow these companies to take advantage of our power, while continuing to unconsciously harm the environment and the people behind our clothing. Our money is their fuel, without our money they have nothing, which makes me optimistic, however, trying to change the minds of millions to use their power wisely as the consumers makes me feel very pessimistic as well.




</p><hr>


<p>

I find the point brought up about corporations blaming the consumer for environmental issues more than a bit disingenuous because they act as mere servants to the whims of the people, when they themselves are not wholly truthful. In the video “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion”, Minhaj illustrates how fashion companies use vague terms such as “sustainability” and “eco-friendly” in misleading ways because the consumer is unlikely to do any deep diving into their records and find out the truth behind their statements. Consumers are overall fairly ignorant as to the true environmental effects of their purchases because these corporations attempt to be inconspicuous about their business practices, such as the usage of child labor in producing goods. Even when they are cognizant of it, many of us ignore it because we do not see it right before our very eyes. The only way these practices can change is if pressure from the right places are placed upon the corporations. Yet the sad part is, these corporations have the power to fight back. Consumerism has created giants out of men, and we might not have the power to control them in turn.

True Cost gave rise to a range of emotions. I watched this documentary along with my girlfriend and she also exhibited the exact same feelings of frustration, sadness, and anger. In the film, Kate Ball Young was asked about her thoughts regarding the treatment of garment workers and working conditions inside of factories. She responded saying, “They’re doing a job. Uh- there are a lot of worse things that they could be doing.” She then expressed how the garment industry is relatively safe and not as dangerous as coal-mining. Her opinions came across as extremely privileged and insensitive towards workers and humans in general. It is extremely selfish to hear anyone express discernment towards their treatment because it minimizes the inhumane conditions that they are facing while also neglecting the safety and wellness of the new and upcoming generations. 
   <br><br>
 Hearing personal anecdotes and seeing the first hand effects of the fashion industry altered my views on the consumption of fast-fashion pieces. I have always found it hard to walk away from a sale but after watching the course documentaries, specifically True Cost and Minimalism, I have spent way more time on questioning my own consumption patterns. I have also begun to question my own ideologies surrounding the fulfillment and satisfaction that I have attached to clothing, shoes, and other items. I love fashion but I want to work on becoming more intentional and mindful of what I buy and how I treat those items. The film discusses an article titled Consumptionism which described two types of products, long term products and items that are used up and disposable. We sometimes treat the long term products as if they are disposable. Our product waste and usage are reflective of the privilege that we have and often abuse.

The True Cost Documentary, produced by Andrew Morgan, depicts a trip around the world, especially in India and Bangladesh, to make its audience have an understanding of fast fashion and its horrific human cost. Throughout the movie, Andrew Morgan records a lot of terrific scenes with harsh environments, toxic chemicals, and crowded space. The manufactory workers in India and Bangladesh have been working in such a dehumanized place for several years. Although they work for long hours every day, they can only get low wages. The consumers to buy those fashionable clothes should have an awareness of the process behind those production. As a woman says in this movie, “people have no idea how difficult it is for us to make the clothing” (Morgan). After watching this movie, I was deeply impressed by the hard-working of these Indian workers. They represent “hero,” but, unfortunately, they are not be respected and honored by those who should much praise them. They contribute a lot to the manufactory.
   <br><br>

Moreover, the data proposed in this movie attracts me a lot. According to the statistics, over 250000 Indian farmers have committed suicide going into debt buying pesticides, which caused the parasitic disease rate extremely high in these areas. It powerfully demonstrates that they are the socially vulnerable groups—without any power to rebel against the government and policy—which leads them to a dark lifestyle. Nowadays, the essential part is that everyone should have an awareness of this problem. The consumers should shift their behaviors to change this situation. However, I think that it might not be that fast to make a dramatic change in the manufactory workers. It is instructive to all of us.

When watching “The true cost”, it was so surprising to see the real influence clothing companies have on other countries that are in economic turmoil and depressions. Before watching the movie, I was already understanding of the fact that U.S. companies take advantage of poor countries in order to make more profit. Little did I know that I was extremely unaware of the real dangers of these selfish companies, and how much they impact the environment, labor, and landfills. It was so surprising to hear at the beginning of the movie, that the U.S. only makes 3% of their own clothes. The other 97% are from other countries, such as India, Bangladesh, etc. 
   <br><br>

One scene that made me even more disappointed about the fashion industry, was the building collapsing in India. Even though management had been notified of the buildings weak structure, the negligence of the clothing company had caused the death and injuries of hundreds of people. 
   <br><br>
The argument that these clothing industries make for the poor treatment of their workers is the fact that their lives could be “so much worse” without the company putting these clothing manufacturing buildings in their area. I would argue that this view is immoral at every level as they dont take into account that these people are humans, not some workers that they can treat however they want. 
   <br><br>

Near the end of the movie when they were introducing places such as Kanpur and Cambodia, it inspired me to want to help out these individuals. Living with terrible conditions with very low wages is something that should not be taken lightly, and I think that these clothing companies need to do more and more to accompany our neighbors. It was so disappointing and frustrating to visualize what these people go through on a daily basis, just to fuel our desires. 
   <br><br>


I had never really been exposed to visualizing the environmental impact the clothing industry has on the United States, and how much more it affects the countries we take advantage of. Watching these people being forced to live next to our chemicals, trash, and waste was absolutely shocking.

I have no idea when I first learned about outsourcing. It's been with me so long. I remember in middle school where my class did an activity to list the places where the clothes we were wearing came from. I expected more "Made in China" because everyone knows everything's made it China (sarcasm), but countries I didn't expect popped up. We were then introduced to sweatshops. 
   <br><br>
Basically, like you and many others, I already knew about how U.S. companies have taken advantage of less developed countries. The movie wasn't actually that shocking for me. It seemed rather predictable. The moment the brave lady mentioned a union and going to see the store owners, I knew before she said it that they had been beaten as a result. Sure, the building's collapse was absolutely terrible to hear about, but I had already heard of a fire and people being burned to death in garment factories. You could say that I've become desensitized, but I prefer to think of it as forgetting. It's easy for people to forget what they don't want to know. I bet that no one checked their clothing tags and got rid of their clothing made in Bangladesh or India after watching the movie. It's easy to feel a flash of sympathy, but it's harder for that flash to last and for people to actually do something. Not a single person won't feel bad about the workers' situation, but it won't affect their daily lives much or at all. I remember in the movie that some guy rationalized the industry's actions by saying that workers would have worse lives if not for U.S. business. It's shameful, but I admit that I did fall for the reasoning, even if it was just a second. That guy, and every other person who somehow believes that excuse, is living in denial that the U.S. has harmed and is harming people who don't deserve it. There are four types of people: those who deny, forget, don't know, and the ones who actually try to do something about it. I'm hoping that there isn't a fifth category of people who don't care for human lives.

The true cost is a documentary on the clothes we wear. It delves into the impacts the clothing industry has on those who make it and the world/environment. Over the years, costs of clothing have decrease, for the consumer. However, the human cost has grown greatly. The film transitions from well dressed individuals to the drag, dark production sites of that clothing, These conditions have grown due to the demand for clothing and the need lower production costs for large corporations to increase revenue. The film also shows how the production of clothing the US has shifted from local to offshore, causing the work conditions for the clothing sold in the US to be unregulated and hazardous, while US companies profit off of these conditions.
    <br><br>
The film also touches on the fact that after clothing has gone out of style, even if we donate it, very little of it is actually resold. The film also exposes the chemical damage production causes in the growth of genetically modified cotton that requires pesticide and fertilizer which increase the risk of cancer in surrounding areas. The film is overall a stab at consumerism and excess and a demonstration of the actual costs of it.

I personally do not buy into the idea of overconsumption, buying only the clothes and devices I need, buying used devices, taking care of old clothes, and using things until they no longer function. The movie held a powerful message that many need to hear, but i personally was not one of them.

In the film “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion”, the terrible truths of the fast fashion industry are examined and exposed. I feel that the host did a great job by keeping the audience’s attention with humor and gravity, as I was surely dialed in.
        <br><br>
   Personally, I didn’t feel like this video impacted me that much. I would way rather buy much higher quality garments and wear them much longer than cheap ones that don’t last long. For example, my favorite pant brand, Lucky Brand, usually has somewhat expensive clothing lines. However, I’ve been wearing them for a couple years now and they still feel great. 
     <br><br>
In the video, I remember the company FashionNova being brought up. While I have never shopped there, I know exactly what the brand is (and many others) due to their overwhelming social media advertisements. I feel like this correlates back to the reading section of this week, as companies are aggressively wanting us to buy their products, and it wont stop unless we think differently as a society.

This film especially hit home for me, as I actually work at H&M downtown. The amount of plastic and paper I throw out every day while processing clothes is horrible. We get new shipments in three times a week, and I work at 6 am every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning before class to make a living, only for me to give them back that money soon later. Fast fashion is by far one of the worst contributors to the climate crisis, and watching this film is just adding to the reasons I feel the need to quit. The business practices that claim to be “eco-friendly” and kind to outsourced workers is just another marketing campaign to boost sales. They don’t care at all about the environment. This film definitely encouraged me to stop buying clothes I don’t need, and I do not plan on supporting fast fashion in the future.

The textile and apparel industry is the second largest polluting industry in the world, after the oil industry. Of course, this is related to the huge clothing consumption every year. After all, everyone has to dress. And the essence of fashion is to innovate, and the introduction of low-cost fast fashion makes it unfortunate even if the clothes are thrown away once. However, this beautiful appearance comes at the cost of huge energy consumption and waste, heavy pollution and cheap labor. From an environmental point of view, what should be done is more intuitive: buy less cheap clothes, buy less cashmere, pay more attention to linen products, pay more attention to the second-hand clothing market, and then expand to reduce red meat consumption and use less disposable items.

While watching "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" I wasn't surprised at the lengths companies were willing to go to make a fast buck. What needs to be understood is the mind of the consumer as it has evolved with the everchanging fashion industry. There has been a shift in how society functions and a large part comes from the influences media, more specifically social media simply due to the fact that so many people take social media as a format as to how to live their lives. In order to somewhat replicate how influencers or celebrities live their lives, there are folks trying to keep up with the trends and they can do so with fast fashion. The constant rotation of clothes though means that there will be waste which means more damage as well. People should wear clothes more often and I'm guilty of doing that as well, I'll buy an outfit for the night and wear it once while it sits in my closet for days on end. It is an issue that only continues to grow and this isn't something to put only on the people who are like me, because there are many celebrities who promote fast fashion like Cardi B for an example. The rich may not buy the cheaper brands as much but do buy in excess with their elaborate and expansive closets with many articles of clothing, accessories, and shoes or their huge houses. But with this video, I was able to view the statistics that were absolutely astounding and see how corporations love to lie and use ambiguity.

I cried while watching the documentary “True Cost”. Seeing the effects of the clothing industry and my spending habits really had an impact on me. I had never even heard about the tragedies in Bangladesh until I watched this movie. I was astonished at the figures they presented; the global fashion industry is a 3 trillion dollar company and we purchase about 80 billion clothing pieces per year. The fact that the owners of the factory in Bangladesh knew about the structural integrity of the building and did absolutely nothing to protect the workers breaks my heart. So much so that my friend and I have decided to boycott fast fashion. Like one of the men in the movie said “are your clothes really worth the blood of [their] people?” They are not. No piece of clothing is worth the life of a factory worker. So, from now on we will only be shopping at thrift stores or stores that do not unethically outsource their labor to foreign countries. Since watching the movie, I have been researching clothing stores and their labor policies and environmental policies. The amount of stores that use sweatshop labor is astounding. The disregard for human life in order to make money and climb the capitalist ladder makes me sick and it should make you sick too. The lives of other people should be more important than money and success. These fast-fashion store owners are using and abusing millions of people for financial gain. This is morally wrong and reminiscent of a dictatorship hierarchy.

Sadly, the fashion industry as a whole is terrible in terms of regard for human life. As with most corporations, everything is about profiting and that only. That's why you see companies such as Nike, Forever 21, and other big fast-fashion companies outsourcing their labor to countries with less fortunate labor practices such as Bangladesh and China. Once again, sad, I know. However, as terrible as these working conditions are, these are some of the best opportunities for one to get enough money to provide for their families, which is why boycotting these companies is a double-edged sword. Yes, on one hand, you are forcing companies to be more conscious of how disgusting their actions are, but on the other hand, you are taking away potential wages from workers who need it the most.

     <br><br>

On another (more positive) note, thrift shopping and secondhand clothing are great! Ever since I've decided to get the majority of my clothes from ethically responsible shops, I've noticed that the quality of the clothes is actually better than those of fast-fashion companies, surprisingly. Additionally, you are making a great environmental impact through this practice, as clothing waste contributes greatly to carbon emissions and landfill volume!

I agree with your emotion pertaining to the effects of the clothing industry. I think we all began to take out own consumption and spending habits into account. I watched a film similar to True Cost which discussed the falling of Rana Plaza and I wanted to cry when I first heard of this. Like you said, no piece of clothing is with the life of a factory worker. It is so frustrating that they do not have the same privileges that we have. This highlights the importance of us using our privilege to aid those who can not help themselves. In the film, the manager of a garment factory spoke about how her and other workers were attacked and assaulted once they delivered their demands to management. It is so heart wrenching that it is difficult to even stand up in the essence of oppression and explotiation.

After watching the "The True Cost," I learned that rich countries don't make clothes themselves, but build factories in other countries or buy them directly.Many people in poor countries work in very harsh conditions to meet our needs. Everyone overworks every day for a piteously low salary, because entrepreneurs squeeze workers to cut costs in order to make more profits. Their treatment is very unfair, although the factory provides them with many jobs, but this is not an excuse to squeeze workers. Overpopulation means that they can only accept such unfair treatment. If they don't accept such conditions, there will be someone to take your place. It seems that rich countries give poor countries a chance to make money, but in reality the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

I watched “The True Cost” for the first time about three years ago, and it entirely transformed the way I view the fashion industry and my own consumer habits. I believe the film is effective in its communication, employing pathos and presenting the information in a vernacular, well-supported way that highlights the issues for both casual viewers new to the topic and those concerned and looking to learn more. The film really caused me to question my own choices and how I viewed consumption, invoking both an intellectual and emotional response. After watching it, it completely changed how I view my purchases, causing me to research all the brands that I frequented, and eventually I made a shift into shopping at only second-hand stores for the most part. Seeing how my attitudes changed, it makes me optimistic for the fact that others are learning about the issue as well, hopefully causing them to make lifestyle changes that promote more socially and environmentally positive habits and purchases. On the other hand, there is an extent of pessimism that arises in me as well with the fact that the film won't reach the hugest audience, and that many are too resistant to changing their lifestyles to counter fast fashion. 
     <br><br>
I would definitely recommend this film to everyone, the topic is so so important and needs to be a bigger topic of discussion. Our everyday choices regarding consumption have such a big impact on both the planet and those living here and that needs to be well known.

"The True Cost" and "Patriot Act" communicate the social and environmental implications of the global fashion industry in two different ways. Both touch upon this idea of "fast fashion" where retailers are manufacturing an increased variety of products at an accelerating rate in order to get consumers to buy more. "The True Cost" is a full length documentary while the episode from "The Patriot Act" is a 30 minute comedy segment, and I think both contribute to raising awareness and get people to make more conscious decisions on what clothes they buy. Since "The True Cost" is longer it is able to explore the issues a little deeper than what is covered in the "Patriot Act".  I think the film did a good job at not only showing the faults of fast fashion but also addressing the common excuses for defending the industry and how they do not hold up. "Patriot Act", on the other hand, is a really valuable tool to introduce people to the issues because of how entertaining it is. In addition, its 30 minute run-time makes it a lot more attractive for people that may not initially be interested in learning about fast fashion. Both methods of telling the story of fast fashion are valuable but I think the short and entertaining format of the Patriot Act is a good model to pull from for other environmental issues just due to how many full length environmental documentaries exist.

"The True Cost"--a very fitting title for his documentary. It's absolutely sad to see that people in first world countries are living extra comfortably all thanks to the exploitation of other people in poorer countries. While we are whining about our outdated iPhone 8, the people who made that iPhone are obediently working in unacceptable working conditions for extremely way less than minimum wage--Some places as mentioned in the documentary have people working for just $2 a day! It's crazy to think that the sweater I could be wearing right now might have come from the same people who survived the collapse of the sweatshop where many people died. The cost of our clothes and latest gadgets is more than just the number on the price tag. It's the suffering of the people in poorer nations who work endlessly in harsh conditions because they do what they need to in order to save up for the bare necessities. Companies like Apple have enough money to pay more to these people making the iPhones.

     <br><br>

This might be off topic but there has been a lot of praise about this movie called Parasite. I've watched it recently and I highly recommend. It's a movie that's better watched if you don't know the plot, but the movie is symbolic for the difference in class. It may seem like, in the movie, the poorer family is living off the rich family, but in reality, the reason why rich people are able to live comfortably is because they live off the backs of the poor who are exploited, which is completely true. Most people in the US are able to wear clothes that are "fast fashion" and have iPhones because of the unfortunate exploitation of the people in poorer nations. It's also not like these people can go on strike until they get better pay or working conditions. Life is harder, and they do what they can to get ANYTHING that would help their lives and the lives of their families be better.

The film “The True Cost” left me feeling hopeless for the people suffering such horrendous conditions in sweat shops. My sense of hopelessness comes from the sense I got that the cries and protests of those workers fall deaf ears. Workers demand better conditions for the owners, as they justifiably must. However, the factory owners are not greedy millionaires hording the profit, rather, they’re too apart of the exploitative system where those working the most are paid the least. The owners, like the workers, have their hands tied because their refusal work for exploitative prices could mean that they will have no work at all. Of course, the corporation that actually profit from this system must continue this cycle of the abuse and mistreatment of workers to keep the prices low for American customers. Ultimately, I think the control is at the hands of the consumers who are making actively effect the decisions of corporations and further down the supply chain. If there was a massive cultural shift away from purely judging goods on their prices and into considering how ethically and sustainable those goods were made, then perhaps massive changes could be realized.

In terms of how this film impacted me personally, it made me think about and reconsider some of my recent purchases. I was cold at the restaurant that was right next to an H&M store. I decided to go in and buy a hoodie for the simple reason that it was cheap. The value that it brought to me was slight, however, it was still greater than the cheap price that it was on sale for. At the time, I didn’t particularly like the hoodie and it didn’t fit too well, but it was warm and cheap so I bought it on an impulsive decision. Thinking about it now, I regret that decision. The price of me buying and thus wasting a hoodie is greater that the dollar amount. In buying that hoodie, I supported a system that exploits human and environmental costs to keep the dollar cost low.

After watching the film, I found that last week's topics and this week’s really go hand in hand with each other. This film, the true cost, did a good job in showing the effects of not living a minimal lifestyle. While we could be saving the planet by buying less stuff and contributing less to our CO2 emissions, there’s the obvious issue of the exploitation of humans that is going on. The film showed a young woman who is not able to be with her child because she is forced to work long hours and she is still not even able to afford childcare. This was another shocking point to me, the wages that these women are making, I don’t think anyone could ever survive on 2 dollars a day. Also, she mentioned how they were physically punished by the managers/factory owners which is another shocking point to me because we would never allow this to happen here in the US, everyone would rush to offer support and demand action. Yet this is happening in other countries, on a worse scale, and the public doesn’t seem to care enough because our money continues to go towards clothes bought from these industries. I want to say that demanding those countries to enforce stricter labor laws and have more regulations would help solve this problem, but because these countries are dependent on this type of industry, it’s going to be a long time before it happens.

Although “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” was given to us as a supplement for “The True Cost” I would say it is actually superior. In my opinion, it does a great job at exposing the fast fashion industry in a shorter amount of time and in a much more entertaining way. Of course, “The True Cost” goes more in depth on how the fast fashion industry works. The film shows us the horrible working conditions of the workers that produce our clothes in third world countries. The film also shows us how some of these workers feel about these conditions. These are some of the things that “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” doesn’t really offer us, but of course it's due to the shorter time of the episode compared to the film.
      <br><br>

 “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” tells us about the huge growth of these fast fashion companies in the clothing industry. The host of the show, Hasan Minhaj, tells us that other clothing companies want to get into fast fashion in order to increase their sales. Hasan Minhaj goes on to tell us that many people don’t realize how harmful the production of these clothes and fabrics is to the environment. He goes on to tell us that Americans throw away a lot of their clothes, and that donating them is not that much better. A lot of the clothes that aren’t given away are then sold to third world countries, who then end up burning some of it because some of the clothes are trash. Hasan then goes on to expose how some of these fast fashion companies are pretending to be “eco-friendly”. This angered me a bit because not only are these companies harming our planet, but they are also lying to and fooling the consumers. To close off the episode, Hasan gives the viewers a simple solution to help out, which I really liked. He suggests that we just wear our clothes for a longer time and/or that we buy second hand items. I believe this is something extremely easy to do, and I hope that most of us can do this after watching this video.

"The True Cost" shook me to my core. Sure, like most Americans, I knew sweatshops were bad, but I had no clue just how backwards they are. Listening to the story about the collapse of buildings in Bangladesh, I could not help but remember nightmarish tales of British factories in the height of the industrial revolution, hundreds of years ago. Nations like the UK and the US that are "developed" quickly realised the horrors of unchecked capitalism, and thus allowed for the creation of labor unions to defend the workers, and yet, it is multinationals from these very nations that perpetrate these atrocities and seemingly ignore the negative impact they are having on these workers. While these companies can distance themselves by saying they "do not own" these factories and therefore cannot control how the factories are run, the omnipresent threat of multinationals leaving and going to another, cheaper place for labor forces those running the factories to do anything within their power to cut costs and produce as many products as they can for as cheaply as they can, maximizing profit for the multinational corporations. At best, this practice is morally disgusting, as these factory workers have little choice,  and are forced to work in these horrendous conditions without any semblance of unionization. When workers even spoke of organizing into unions, they were beaten, illustrating the barbarity of the factories multinationals employ. Realistically, these huge companies are commiting countless murders every year, and, if not killing their factory workers, they are subjugating them to a life akin to serfdom in the medieval ages.
       <br><br>

I was astounded by how deep the roots of capitalism go, and with it the vertical cooperation of all entities to maximize profit. Monsanto in particular blew me away with the stories of over a quarter million Indian farmers commiting suicide because they could not pay their debts to Monsanto, who held a monopoly on the genetically modified cotton seeds that are resistant to pesticides. I had no clue that organic cotton is such an important organic for us to use regularly, and probably would not have known if not for this documentary. The blatant disregard for human life that runs rampant behind the scenes in a capitalist world economy is sickening, and, completely ignoring the economic impacts which are numerous, demand change immediately. Now let me clarify that I am not saying Marxist world revolution is the only answer, but the United States and other developed nations must hold multinationals based within their countries accountable for their actions and prevent greater detriment to human life abroad.

I feel like it’s easy to ignore the consequences of participating in consumerism in the moment. While we only get to see the final, new, flashy product, we seldom see the process that went into mass producing it or the negative effects that come after. This is especially true in the context of fast fashion; we see the product, we see the affordable price, then we buy it without another thought with the only internal conflict being “do I really need this right now?” The True Cost, however, forces us to look at the operation behind fast fashion and the consequences behind those good deals.
       <br><br>

 This film was very gutting. Knowing that people in those third world countries endure such terrible conditions for something that we often end up throwing away without a second thought   should infuriate us. They go to work not knowing if they’ll make it back home in the same condition as they left, or if they’ll even make it back alive. These workers’ lives are just seen as casualties and the workers themselves are viewed as easily replaceable.

After watching "The True Cost", I was brainwashed by the facts provided in the video. When coming to the problem of climate crisis, most of us will pinpoint the problem towards excessive driving, during fossil fuels, burning waste and etc instead of buying too many clothes. The fashion industry has unseeable impacts that has harmed our world. All the fast fashion industry brands are accelerating the rate of new clothes. In this way people are creating countless waste. It's astonishing to see that now we have 52 seasons a year particularly for fashion. That's just...crazy. People are buying too many clothes without even thinking whether they really need it or not. I feel so related to the topic because I personally feel the same. After watching the advertisements on TV, social medias, the ads before the Netflix tv series, I always think I am not possessing enough. 
       <br><br>
When seeing that the fashion industries are trying to justify their overuse of workers and the poor working conditions the workers were woking in, I feel guilty because it's our consumers' behaviors that cause their sufferings. When comes to the problem of who should be blamed, it's always a two-side sword. That's what ken mentioned in the video and I can't agree more. Consumers' needs drive the industry to fulfill our desires, but at the same time the industry plans about what they are trying to sell to consumers. The industry itself is using various ways to produce consumers for them to generate economic profits. "Business is making us into the beings that serve them best consumers." 
       <br><br>
However, the crazy desires are harmful to our environment and the species living on out planet. We are fulfilling our desires but are causing others suffering. How should this scenario be justified? That's the question that should bump in out head whenever we are buying "extra" stuff.




</p><hr>


<p>
I felt polarized while watching this film. Although I agreed with the underlying message that we are being wasteful and that this amount of consumption is being done at the expense of the environment sometimes, there are benefits that come from our compulsive spending. Such as employing individuals in a country that are already poor, to have a source of income.
       <br><br>

The part I disagreed with was that the poor working conditions are the consumers' fault. This is completely false in my opinion. It is the responsibility of the government of whatever country the factory is located in to assure that its citizens are not forced to work under these atrocious conditions. The argument that the companies want things produced as cheaply as possible and that this forces the factories to have poor conditions just ignores the fact that the blatant corruption that goes on in these countries allow for the workers to be exploited like this. The greed of government officials willing to do whatever it takes to get the production in their country no matter the cost is the real issue.

       <br><br>

As much as I dislike the fact that the US government turns a blind eye to these fashion companies that know very well what they’re doing, excessive consumer spending is giving the means of survival to many of these workers. It’s not a trivial discussion.

Because I have already seen "The True Cost", I decided to watch  "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion".  I was stricken to see how well the producers and Hasan Minhaj were able to put the show together, compiling so much information while making it enjoyable to watch.  Usually, films and shows that discuss such serious topics can seem to drag for me, so I liked the fact that Minhaj was able to keep me interested and focused and the matter he was discussing. While watching the short film, I was most surprised to learn about how many fast fashion industries use misleading labels and taglines to persuade consumers into thinking that they are helping the environment. I too have fallen for this scheme. There have been times that I can remember actually feeling good about a purchase because I knew that while the consumption of the product may not be great, at least it was either going towards a cause to help the environment, or itself produced from renewable sources, etc. Personally, I feel like it should be illegal or at least not allowed for companies to provide misleading information about their clothing because there are many people who try to buy consciously but might not have the means or ways to purchase from places where quality and grade might make the clothing last longer and have better grade, so they have relied on these fast fashion companies to not only provide them with more affordable clothing that is still aiming towards their views, but also to actually make an impact into wanting to make better clothing that does not harm the environment and its lower class people. 
       <br><br>
I was also interested in the theory that social media is what has caused an influx in consumerism within the fast fashion industry. I'm not sure why I have never taken it into account to be a main factor, but throughout the past year or so of me trying to learn more about the epidemic, the biggest question I always had was,  How did we let fast fashion get so big? I knew that by introducing more seasons, making clothes cheaper, etc of course consumerism would rise, but Minhaj made me consider how our lives lived on social media contributed greatly to the rise. I also would like to note how knockoffs are completely legal even if they only have small subtle changes in the piece. 
       <br><br>
Overall, I applaud Minhaj and the producers of "The Patriot Act" by making the film comical and entertaining while loading a great amount of information on the topic of fast fashion.

<p>

I don't think that businesses are solely to blame for consumerism, the consumer plays an equal role. Brainwashing children from a young age to be loyal to your brand is bad from the company's side, but I think that parents are equally to blame. They shouldn't be letting these corporations influence their children so much, and if that means turning off the TV and spending time with their children then they should do that.
       <br><br>
I think that consumerism is something that is tied to human nature. We want to accumulate resources so that in times of trouble, we have something to fall back on. Historically, this meant having extra food to survive the winter, or something similar. Today, in developed nations, this is something we don't have to worry about but we continue to practice the same behaviors which can get out of hand.

The film "The True Cost" was heart-wrenching when it showed clips of poor working conditions that the workers had to go through. Many of these poor working conditions are then the main reasons for the disasters that happen. The sweatshops are forced to compete with one another in terms of lowest production price. It's all a big cycle that ties into the "52 fashion seasons per year" dilemma.

       <br><br>

I found it sickening at how some people (who live in the US, a place with arguably some of the best living/working conditions compared to the rest of the world) didn't see a problem with these sweatshops. They viewed it as vital as a way to increase level in terms of living/working conditions. The privilege is there and it shows.

       <br><br>

The solution to this would be to enforce safety laws and give more power to unions that would help the workers. Companies are so caught up in making money that they disregard human lives, instead seeing people as expendable.

“Every week there’s something I can’t do because it's killing the planet”. This quote from the patriot act exactly represents how I feel from being in this class. But regardless this was a very informative episode which I saw before even being enrolled in this class. Rewatching now with the added context of this class, it is having a much stronger impact on me. Though the statistics are shocking, they’re not surprising. This is just another example of corporate greed destroying the environment. The companies mentioned in the episode couldn’t give a shit about the environment because it’s all about the bottom dollar. It is even more evident because their “recycled” clothes programs are just as bad. They just needed to create the illusions of being environmentally friendly so that people won’t feel bad for buying their clothes. 
       <br><br>
The thing that bothered me the most was what they did with discarded clothes. They just see throwing them away in Africa as a good solution. All those thousands of pounds of clothes just being set ablaze rather than being repurposed. It’s honestly disappointing but I should’ve known the bar was set that low. These companies will play the game over and over until something actually stops them. They will just keep destroying the planet then people will get mad then they find some loophole which is “environmentally friendly” then people will go back to buying their product. Rinse and Repeat.

<p>
"The True Cost" reveals the facts about how bad the fashion culture hurts our environment, yet another thing we never have the consciousness that it could be so terrific as it just seems so simple and harmless. Again that just reinforces the idea how most of our trending consumer cultures always just seem harmless, and when it comes to satisfying consumers, the industries would do anything including not just wasting and polluting environments, but also bullying the cheaper industries in poorer countries. It all comes back to the fundamental problem of a life-style we chose and got used to, people who do the business will not hand on the dark facts behind his business, politicians only care about taking controls and pay no attentions on the system of slow-destruction we created, so the task is up on us no to make moves. We have to raise consciousness and speak up on the truths and bad consequences and let the culture change, but first we need to do our part on not supporting the environmental-unfriendly lifestyle ourselves. And we have to take control and gain as much political power as possible, to obtain more opportunities to speak up and louder voice, or even direct controls over our current industries chain.


</p><hr>


<p>

The purpose or rallying call of "The True Cost" was certainly one I can get behind. This film definitely proposed one of the more modest calls to action that we've seen this quarter. While some arguments surrounding anthropogenic climate change can be quite extreme and difficult to actually act upon, the modern fashion industry is definitely something we can abandon for the sake of the planet. We cause so much harm to the environment for simply cosmetic reasons. While we may lose valuable resources if we abandon fossil fuels, all we would lose from the fashion industry is the suffering it causes. From the child labor common within Asian production of clothing to the excessive amount of carbon dioxide that clothing factories expel into the atmosphere, there are no true benefits to holding on to this absurd market.

On a more individual scale, it is all too true how wasteful we are when it comes to these clothes. As a child, my parents would have to buy me practically a whole new batch of clothes yearly, if not twice a year, as I was growing and clothes no longer fit. Even if we donated my clothes that I grew out of, which didn't occur every time anyway, it was more likely than not that those clothes would end up in the trash. The use of an abundance of clothing for only child seems absurd in this perspective but the problem only escalates in regards to suburban moms who own a different shirt for everyday of the year. The fashion industry, on a global scale, is most certainly doing more bad to the planet than it is doing anywhere close to good.

Hasan Minhaj's Patriot Act about fast fashion was great talking about the impacts of fast fashion, and about how much fast fashion labels were greenwashing their brands super well. I hope we get to see him again.

<p>
I watched both films, and they were talking about something that I feel like I only know a little about. I have never realized that a single person could buy that many clothes in a year and only wear those for a few times and then left them being those clothes that got donated to be burned. 68 pieces of clothing equal to more than one clothes per week. And what is more shocking to me is that if one person has worn his/her clothes for more than 9 months, the carbon footprint for that person would reduce. When Hasan Minhaj in the Patriot Act says that “...the clothed in your suitcase are screwing up the planet more than the flight you put them on”, I was so shocked. Especially that I, being an international student, am always traveling between countries, and I am always carrying two or more suitcases of stuff, which is far more than what an average American will carry with them when goes on a plane, with me when I take the fight. I keep thinking about whether I have bought the things that I really need, whether I have bought the things that will last longer so that I would not throw them away really fast. People are focusing on fast-evolve fashion instead of the long-lasting one.

After watching the film "The True Cost", I felt a weight added on my conscious when looking at my clothing. Coming from a low-income household, fast fashion has been a staple for my family. We often see the low-price and become blinded towards the origins of the article. Why would we think of the ethical background of the clothing, if we are able to make ends meet by purchasing at these unsustainable corporate business. We need to create alternative methods mainstream in order to steer away from spending our dollar and interest from these "green" companies. For example growing up there was a large stigma wearing second hand clothing even though we could not afford to continue to purchase new articles of clothing. We should push the public to consume from thrift shops, yard sales, and wholesalers. We often treat clothes as if they have a expiration date when in reality they are meant to last us. By wanting to partake in the newly established 52 seasons in the fashion industry we not only hurt human lives, but the environment as well. In the film the Rana Plaza accident was highlighted through narrative of the impacted families. A knock-off of the high fashion runway is not worth the detriment we are causing to other countries. Many of these "third-world"  countries are only granted this opportunity for a living and while participating they risk their lives and the livelihood of future generations. 

       <br><br>

It is disheartening to see that those who create unions are reprimanded and beaten for their actions. They are forced to endure these conditions while we are allowed the choice of our style of clothing and the source we obtain them from. We do not attach that we are trapping other humans in order to buy these garments, that at this rate of consumption, are no longer considered necessities. These purchased items are left to be returned to these countries and create a landfill of clothes that are left to burn.

Watching this film has giving me a whole new perspective, on the fashion industry and even on the clothes I wear, and I never knew how toxic the fashion industry was to not only people but to the environment as well. This documentary really made me rethink about all the clothing I have bought and will continue to buy. I think what really hurt me the most was seeing the people in third world countries suffer on our behalf, watching these people working in these inhumane conditions just to survive and make a decent living. Overall, this film showed me how greedy and blindsided most Americans are, we do not care about what the cost will be as long as we look good or we are number one, and that sucks knowing we live in a world where we only prioritize ourselves. I learned a lot of new things watching this documentary, for one I did not know that clothing was the second highest thing that caused pollution, after oil and that really shocked me, because even though I do donate a large portion of my used clothing to charity, a lot of that still ends up as waste.

As someone who has recently spent a lot of money on new clothes, especially from major fast-fashion corporations like Forever 21, H&M, and Pacsun, I feel great remorse after viewing the film. These companies present themselves as the best good; convenient, cheap, and accessible. But at what cost? People slave to bring us the clothes that we buy with almost little to no benefit to them. So when a company inserts themselves as the good and sells their products cheaply and conveniently they make the mold for what is acceptable.  People will be reluctant to change because they are so used to what they have been doing for so long. The only way to solve this is with education and even then takes a lot on the half of the person to implement these changes into their lifestyles and the lives they influence.

<p>
The true cost was extremely eye opening to the fact that many people suffer for the comfortability of Americans and other major world nations. These poor people are working in unsuitable conditions and are getting paid less than minimum wage without any health benefits. Not only is this extremely immoral it also adds significantly to the CO2 pollution in the atmosphere. These factories hold children, men, and women of all ages working to make the new Levi pants that we so desperately need. The reality of this is that it’s a world that we as the consumers have created. I was extremely saddened to hear about all the factory accidents that have occurred in the past decade and I’m deeply confused as to why this is not a bigger issue then it is made out to be. People from other countries are literally slaving away to make our clothes and it’s as if we see no issue with it. I for one wouldn’t want any of my family members to work in a sweat shop, so the thought of thousands of different families working in one sickens me. 
       <br><br>
We need to hold this companies accountable for their process in which they make clothes or else, as time tells, they will continue to do it with no regard for their victims. We also need to hold ourselves accountable for once in our lifetime. I believe that because we are privileged to live in America that we are blinded to the atrocities that occurs in other parts of the world. Some caused by us, and others by another form of injustice whether it be a person, company, or government.The people that own these sweatshops have no regard for human life and have let money become more valuable then life itself. An extra buck at the expense of a life is never worth the trade off however to these big cooperation it’s just another statistic on a chart.

In the film “The True Cost”, the filmmakers were very effective at conveying their message to the viewers. They go and show you the horrible and heart-crushing facts about the fast fashion industry. Such as the terrible working conditions at the factories in Bangladesh and showing the gruesome aftermath of a building collapse that killed so many workers. The example Ken talked about with the makeup company describes every single company. All these companies want you to do is for you to buy their products and to keep buying them. Personally, I’ve never been a big proponent of just buying clothes whenever you want or can. It’s crazy to learn that we purchased about 80 billion pieces of clothing every year. Yet, there are so many people around the world who can’t even purchase their next meal. It’s truly disheartening to see and learn about all the environmental effects that this fast fashion industry is causing

I am a fan of the Netflix show The Patriot Act because it uncovers overlooked issues in our modern world. This being said, watching the episode "The Ugly Cost of Fashion" did just that. The video exposes the wildly overlooked, or even just unimagined effects of modern day shopping culture. Hasan Minhaj comedically informs us of the dark reality of fast fashion and the excessive consumer culture in America. The fast fashion industry's impact on the environment is alarming. In part by its production, which consumes a large amount of water, and also by its validation of a throwaway culture. Coupled with the degrading treatment of sweatshop workers in less developed countries, there are overwhelming reasons to protest against fast fashion and consumerism. Ken asks a very interesting question in this video, whether we put the blame on the companies or the people. Akin to a symbiotic relationship in the wild, shopping in the fast fashion era is almost unavoidable, at least for those who can not afford to buy expensive items of clothing humanely manufactured and eco-friendly. Therefore, those who do not have the means to purchase products with a morally sound background are left with the only option of purchasing cheap items involuntarily supporting all of there harmful effects; the more of these cheap products that are bought, the more profit for the business that is distributing the product and sustaining the fast fashion culture. 
       <br><br>
It is a messed up situation (to keep it professional). I think that companies are largely to blame for this. The average consumer is not a mal intentioned person who makes their decisions on the basis of "most harmful thing I can do for this planet". Companies in the other hand, strategically market themselves to attract as many customers as possible in lieu of their environmental impact or the exploitation of their workers. Evil.

Watching The True Cost was heartbreaking. It’s really hard to watch how the fast fashion industry is causing so much destruction and trauma in the environment and people’s lives, especially when the people suffering are so removed from the product they are making. You would never see a fast fashion worker wearing anything that remotely resembles the clothes they are making, yet the industry has complete control over entire communities and their economies. The only way to take away the power of the fast fashion industry is with a major cultural shift, but it seems like we are actually moving in the opposite direction. In the past, affordable clothing options have been either second hand or fast fashion, but now that thrift shopping has become more trendy, I’ve noticed prices soaring for second hand clothes. This makes sustainable fashion less accessible, and leaves fast fashion as the major market for affordable clothes. Hopefully, society will find a way to eliminate the damage done by fast fashion, but I fear that won’t happen until it’s too late.

Before watching “The Ugly Truth Of Fast Fashion”, I never new that these synthetic materials we but are literally made out of fossil fuels. It was also surprising to hear that there are charities that sell clothes to buyers in developing countries if they are not sold or given away within a month’s time. I understand why they would try to sell clothes to people in developing countries if they were also trying to sell them in the United States, but none of the clothes that were being given away should subsequently be sold for profit to people from another country who are much less wealthy. Also though, when the African guy said the clothes were dumped there, that’s inaccurate because they bought them. If you buy clothes from someone and then see them eventually pile up in trash heaps, either from not selling all the clothes or from people using them and then discarding them, that’s on you. Because you bought them, those clothes were put into your country and eventually piled up in those trash heaps.

After watching the film "The True Cost" I was aware of the fast fashion industy if creating not only an injustice to the earth but to people and families as well. Millions of lives are affected as people are overworked and put in danger for such little pay. The film goes over the danger of what it takes to produce items by big brands such as H&M. The dangers of production begin at the very beginning as people growing the cotton are risking their lives spreading chemicals into the plants in order to produce more and quicker. Then, people actually producing the clothes are overworked and often placed in danger as work places are not up to standard and often overcrowded in order to meet the demands of these large clothing brands. While its easy to place all the blame on the fast fashion industry, everyone who buys these products are contributors to these injustice as well. By buying these products we are giving the okay to these injustice and encouraging these industries to continue to demand more and more from the producers which will make these work places much more dangerous in order for them to met demands.

“The True Cost” does an excellent job of showing the horrendous working conditions workers endure in sweatshops where a larger majority of our clothes are made. It also demonstrates the cruelty the workers endure by their employers. It’s even more saddening to know that as we continue to make these purchases, these workers are expected to work and produce more which can affect not just themselves, but also their families. When the lady who works at sweatshop mentions how their boss has been violent I couldn’t help but feel guilty. To know as long as we keep feeding into the fashion industry, this will continue is disgusting. In “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion", Hasan Minhaj does an excellent job of getting important information across while using humor. Watching the show, I sometimes laughed, but then immediately felt guilty. One of the most surprising pieces of information he presented was the part of environmental friendly brands and how in reality they are not. When he exposes brands like Zara and H&W is powerful, especially when he creates his own fast fashion pop up story to inform buyers about the ecological grades of clothing. It truly is a scam. 
        <br><br>

Both "The True Cost" and "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" had an impact on me because they caused me to question old and recent purchases I have made and how I decide when I need to make them. One way in which I decide whether to buy an item or not is on the price of the item. Too many times when I have been shopping I have noticed that if an item is “cheap” and I like it, I won’t think twice before deciding to purchase it. I have shopped at stores like Forever 21 and H&M without ever considering any harm. I even have stumbled across cheaper online brands promoted by influencers and made purchases on them. While making these purchases, I knew the quality of the items would not be the best, however, while I always questioned how these items were made, I never bothered to look into it.  “The True Cost” and “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” exposed me to realities that come with buying cheap clothes. While it is important to note that not everyone can spend $100+ on one piece of clothing, I think it is still important to inform others about the dangers of fast fashion. One way we can inform the public about this issue is by showing our friends and family these films, shows, and videos like Ken’s. We can also inform them ourselves, by sitting down and explaining to them the working conditions and little pay workers of sweatshops endure while we get to wear a $8 shirt. Another way to spread the message is through social media. We spend a lot of our time scrolling on apps, we might as well make use of it by informing followers and friends.

After watching "The Ugly Cost of Fast Fashion", I realized how effective this way of presenting the information on fast fashion's effect on the planet could be to viewers. Although the host is discussing a serious topic, he jokes around throughout the video to make the presentation more personable. It is obvious that the host truly wishes to make things better for our planet, but I think he knows that we need to start coming up with different approaches as to how to present the information on anything regarding the climate crisis. It is obvious that he takes a comedic strategy to relay the message to his audience, and I think it is a good idea for more entertainers to spread light on the topic. Nowadays I feel like people are more likely to listen to a celebrity than an actual scientist who studied the crisis at hand. Although this is sad and upsetting, we need to accept this and figure out a way to possibly get the climate scientists, and entertainers together to help convey the important information. A great example of this took place in the film, "The True Cost", with Leonardo DiCaprio and many climate scientists. The film worked very effectively on most viewers as it got many positive remarks. The film was also viewed by a larger amount of people than it would have without DiCaprio in it because of his fame. The last thing I would like to say about "The Ugly Cost of Fast Fashion" is that I am glad it called out the advertisers that advocate young children. Hopefully, many parents were watching this video and were shocked to hear how detrimental the fast fashion industry is to the environment. I also hope that these parents will take the steps needed to limit their children's exposure to such advertisements, and make sure they do not become obsessed with purchasing fast fashion as many young adults are today.

One best thing about watching documentaries is that it shows us the ugly side of the world using a camera, the most expressive technology. I’ve never thought about the problem with the Fast Fashion industry. I appreciated it cause it provides us clothes at a high cost-performance ratio. I never knew that producing clothes will contaminate the environment, and the CO2 emission is even in second place. I’ve seen the center of basic manufacturing moved from places like China to cheaper places like Bangladesh, but I’ll never know such a poor condition these workers endure is where the “cheapness” comes from. 
        <br><br>

Just as Ken mentioned in the video, we, the consumers, should ponder on our habit of “consuming.” And we cannot only get rid of the wasted clothes by simply “donating” them and let them be piled like dumps and hinder other’s development in the clothes industry. Do we feel better donating? Are we really doing good things?

The exploitation of impoverished people and misuse of the limited resources of this land have been brought to the light. This documentary has shown the dark side of the fashion industry, exposing all the damage it does, not only to millions of garment/factory workers but to the planet as well. The film effectively communicates the grave dangers of the continuation of this fashion cycle through flipping through the lives of people who are affected daily by this crucial routine and the gut-wrenching depiction of constant destruction of the environment with mountains of garbage and chlorine infested waters. The title, "The True Cost", effectively embodies the message of the film, depicting the true cost of a garment, the physically taxing human power it takes, as well as the eradication of human resources in places where the resources aren't abundant. The film displays the deterioration of life in 3rd world countries, as garment workers race around the clock on the daily for a meager $3 a day in life-threatening conditions and for what, an $8 t-shirt? 
        <br><br>

Throughout the film, I felt myself shifting from sheer rage to sadness. I was not only enraged by the constant manipulation of human life as if they were toys and the mass consumption at the cost of blood and death but at myself knowing that I was also part of the issue. As well as the idea that the executives of these large corporations utilize the laborer's necessities and desperation for jobs against them, pinning them down with these inhumane wages and deplorable working conditions leaving them only one option, to work. My response was primarily emotional, although I did receive an abundance of information and insight into the fashion industry. The documentary shed light on a familiar topic, but it did teach me about the many loopholes that many corporations slyly pass through in search of the feasibility of mass production and the creation of mass capital. It brought me into account of the first-person testimonies of these people living through this hell, which aided the change in my mindset of the fashion industry and the way I view clothing in itself. It's difficult to believe that there will be any sort of change in the near future, because of the ditch that the fashion industry has sunk itself into. But, the change starts within the consumer, and I for one have been convinced of the tragedies of the industry.

The documentary the true cost reminds another movie "Blood Diamond". Just like the title, it is sad and scary for us to know the true cost about things we are buying. The new dress you bought for a party seems like cost you $20, the ture cost might a life that killed due to the poor and unsafe building construction. Next time you see a dress with bright red color, will that remind you the color of blood and people who were killed by that? Does it sound scary? Unfortunately, it is true. Just like the movie blood diamond says every diamond has a story about blood, because that is how western company treat their labor in Africa to ask them dig diamond. I thought this is only true because diamond is expensive, however cheap clothing industry becomes the same. Whenever you buy a cloth only because it is cheap, you know you are not going to wear it more than once but it is just so cheap and you just do not care about the price. Great, ignore the price, think about the life of those poor people who work $2 a day 12 hours to make that cloth for you. Do you still want to buy it? I like when Ken said imaging a picture that you drive a large suv, live in a large house you do not need and buy a lot of cheap cloth you do not need. Does it feel familiar? Does it look like a typical America family now? This should not be the American dream, American dream should not be a dream full of vanity and materialism.

Hassan does a great job of laying out the facts very clear and obvious. This episode really blew my mind. First of all the fact that Zara, H&M, Fashion Nova and the others can make clothing within a few days was insane to me. Kim K will wear it one day and the next it's in all these stores for the lay people to buy. Also the fact that there are 52 fashion weeks is really problematic. I do remember going back to school shopping and that was a big deal cause it only happened occasionally. As I've grown up I just thought that I have a clothing addiction or shopping addiction and that's why I go shopping all the time but that fact that it's our whole culture is not validating, but really scary. And the environmental impacts of creating a single piece of clothing are so high, its mind blowing. Cotton is bad but synthetics are a full different level. Lulu lemons are made of oil? So scary.
        <br><br>
I told everyone to watch this episode because to me it had quite an impact. One of my housemates asked, does he practice what he preaches? I don't think he does if you look at the clothing that he's wearing in the video. I wonder if he has thought about it, and if he is doing something, or if it's just so hard and so expensive that he doesn't.

It is terrible to see what the fashion industry is built upon and how little it regards our planet. It is inexcusable to see how people are dying just for clothes to be made! To see how the fashion can and does control people’s lives by some of us not having clothes considered popular shows how much power the industry has. The True Cost shining light on all these things that the fashion industry does make me question the clothes that I get and where they come from. It leaves me feeling uncertain as to how much clothing I truly need in life because my whole life I’ve been taught and recommended to get clothes every year or so. Is this really necessary? I think not now because of what this class has taught me about valuing the clothes that I have and to think big picture for our planet and the people on it. The prices that we see at clothing stores have a chain effect on those who are producing them, forcing those who are working in sweat shops to continually contemplate if they should work for so little in the long and truthfully short run.

I believe that the film was extremely effective at communicating its subject by showing viewers the entire scope of the fast fashion industry. The film went into depth describing each step of clothing production and its detrimental effects to humans and mother nature. From the cotton farmers who inhale diseases from fertilizers to the workers who get underpaid and beaten physically to the final tangible product consumers buy, I was able to clearly see the truth about the modern fashion industry today. Throughout the film, they chose many workers who had suffered from factory conditions to voice the harsh reality they face and how every day they are fighting for change to be able to care for themselves and their families. Overall, what makes the story so compelling is the use of horrifying images and videos that proves this is an undeniable problem that needs to be fixed. After watching this film, I initially felt sad, confused, angry, and disgusted. This was the first time I had been exposed to the truth of how unfair and unjust the fashion industry is to the workers across the entire supply chain. It caused me to feel uncomfortable thinking about the clothes that I have bought and wear, where they came from, and if the workers who made my clothes had been treated fairly. Prior to watching this film, I knew that labor laws were very loose in areas like Bangladesh and that they had been treated unfairly throughout the course of history. However, I had no idea the extent of how big and violent a problem this was to the economy, nature, and human well being and health. It was shocking to see even the cotton farmers committing suicides by drinking pesticides because their lives and land had been controlled by huge monopolistic fashion brands. Ultimately this film changed my attitudes towards brands like H & M, Forever 21, Macys, and other massive fashion brands. I feel like I do not want to support these brands because in their attempt to lower prices for consumers to make us feel materialistically powerful, the workers who spend months in harsh working conditions making these clothes get paid less and less. In honesty, I’m extremely optimistic that these kinds of conditions will be recognized by us (consumers) and change will occur, however, I’m pessimistic in the sense that I know that this change won’t occur today and that the factory workers are still getting treated and paid the way they have been ever since fast fashion has emerged. I am glad I was exposed to this film to see the truth that we (Americans) seem to conceal behind a curtain of materialistic wealth and possession.

I think the episode of "Patriot Act" was extremely effective in spreading the word about the true cost of fast fashion. The format of the episode presented the information in a comedic and relatable way that engages the audience. Long documentaries on the horrors behind fast fashion like The True Cost attract a limited number of viewers; the long duration of the film and the grim documental style is probably not as easy and fun to watch for most people as the Patriot Act episode, which is filled with amusing skits and intriguing audience interaction. For example, Hasan Minhaj implemented many references to pop culture and just funny little tidbits that the audience can relate to. The ZARA commercial turned into a Funyun's commercial highlights the ridiculousness of fast fashion companies' superficial attempts to seem eco-friendly and sustainable, the Minhaj's 'popup store' forced the people there to really think about their actions as consumers. Although documentaries like "The True Cost" do a great job of showing the gritty facts and the consequences of fast fashion worldwide, the Patriot Act episode shows us our own closets and really brings it to a personal level.

</p><hr>


<p>

After watching "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" I was surprised at how well Hasan Minhaj was able to reflect on the fast fashion industry in such a comedic but informative approach. I was constantly engaged and entertained by this video and thought it did a good job of exposing how the fast fashion industry works and how it is effecting our planet. I have seen "The True Cost" before and also thought that film did a very good job of describing this industry and the negative impacts it's having on workers and the planet, but think that the average viewer would probably be more engaged in The Patriot Act videos. I think that to expose and engage the average American to the environmental crisis we will need to start thinking out of the box. I think this comedic approach is a perfect example. Rather than watching a documentary that's about an hour and a half, often with a depressing mood and saddening images, this style was high-hearted and quick but still very informative and thought provoking. Although I don't think this youtube video was able to touch on all the important issues of the fast fashion industry as in depth as "The True Cost", I think that it may appeal better to the average viewer who may not have been concerned with this issue before. I also think that the person that chooses to watch "The True Cost" is already concerned with this topic and wants more information, but in The Patriot Act, it is describing fast fashion to a much broader audience. 
        <br><br>

"The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" did a good job at calling out many fast fashion brands such as H&M, Fashion Nova, and Zara, and exposing their business model. I also enjoyed the part of the video where Hasan sets up his own store with items from H&M and then tells the customers about the environmental impact, what the items are actually made out of (such as petroleum), and exposing the greenwashing done by the companies. I was in shock during the part when he exposed the greenwashing tricks, such as when they tried to confuse the customer into thinking the whole shirt was made from recycled materials when in fact it was only the tag on the shirt. I think The Patriot Act video did a wonderful job at describing the fast fashion industry in a new way that may capture the attention of viewers not as aware of the climate crisis.

The Film "The True Cost" highlighted a lot of issues that overconsumption is causing. It is not only affecting the environment but also communities that these companies use. These companies are using the communities as selling it as an opportunity for more jobs and thus more money. However, companies do not care about their works as incidents in Bangladesh continue to occur. There is a reason why companies do not have companies in the US or other wealthier countries.  It is true that it is cheaper but also because the conditions that these factory workers live through are inhumane and wouldn't be tolerated here. This film showed that our overconsumption and our habit of buying then discarded after one use is impacting other people. It is impacting those communities in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and other places but also destroying the environment as CO2 emissions rise and landfills continue to grow.

When watching the film, “True Cost”, it was extremely eye-opening for me. To see and understand the nasty aspects of the fast fashion industry, alongside finding out that many of these companies purely try to find the best way to achieve money at the expense of human lives and rights is purely disheartening. The conditions of the workers is terrible, and having to see that the workers had to go through that is something that shouldn’t have been alright to happen in the first place. 
        <br><br>
I also watched the “The Ugly Cost Of Fast Fashion” which also left me surprised at the fact that our clothes do much more damage to the environment than for example flying. The amount of resources needed for fast fashion is unbelievable and disheartening at the fact that many people still constantly buy from these brands. 
        <br><br>
I think that an effective way to let people know about these statistics and facts about how much the clothes do to the environment is about letting them know the facts at the store with posters or even more like what Hasan did, a pop up store that allowed people to interact with the reality of the clothing that they buy and understand the damage that it does.

Seeing the true side of companies and large scale productions as a whole is very unsettling. Profit and money rule over everything in the world of business at the expense of the happiness of humans. This is a trade-off that is nonsensical, everyone is always pursuing happiness and living in a system that does not make that the main goal is bound to fail ultimately. We are seeing glimpses of this misstep and there needs to be a correction. A correction that brings the the living condition of everyone to a higher level as well as taking care of our planet. We are not separate from all that is around us. Animals and plants and us are all interwoven in this natural world.

I really like the Patriot Act comedy hosting by Hasan Minhaj, and I also think that it is THE most special and effective way of spreading ideas about, well I do not really want to say but, "boring" ideas. It is hard to deny that the passages and articles Ken present for us are too long to fully and precisely read through (Sorry again Ken!!!). Also, their central ideas are not clear enough to understand. However, Hasan's brilliant jokes on brands crammed about recycling clothes made me laugh and, on the other hand, really try to think about the ways they do and we do. The Knockoff fast fashion is a copy of luxury brands like YSL and Dior. Everybody wants to show their best images to others. It is well studied by Social Psychologists. We cannot refuse to that feeling of presenting our best. So we provide demands for the brands, and because of these demands, they will produce tons of clothes for us. So the original crime might really be ourselves, at least in this section. 
        <br><br>
As a new adult, I myself am also entering "the world of Fashion". I started to buy famous brands clothes and sneakers because I feel I need to. I want to be handsome, and I want to find my style of dressing. It is a social good that will benefit both others and myself. So, as a result, I bought more clothes than ever, maybe even more than the sum of the clothes I bought before. But thank GOD I choose to take the ENG23 classes. I realize the first time how much materials it took to make one of my sweaters, jackets, and Tees. Selfishly, I want beauty, but I more want to live. and my life is based on everyone's actions. So I started to find my style in another style- by matching my outfits each day with different clothes. Simply said, it is to try new inside with the same outside. There is an unlimited amount of combos in life. I hope I can try out every unlimited amount within the limited numbers. By that, I would definitely wear them long enough, and, for myself too, find my unique style of dressing up.

Hasan Minhaj’s episode on fast fashion, in my opinion, was a great way to show people our age how a lot of these massive fashion companies are much worse than they think. While I am not a huge fan of the way Minhaj communicates the information -- some of the jokes just fall flat or I can’t really relate to personally, and at times I wish he was a bit more serious -- I still think that it is an effective method when it comes to communicating with younger generations, but for myself, since I have absolutely no care about looking fashionable or buying new clothes unless absolutely necessary, it didn’t have a huge personal impact. But there were lots of facts that he brought up that I had no idea about, such as in 2015 the fashion industry was more harmful to the environment than flying and maritime travel combined. With how devastating flying is on the environment, as Ken brought up in his lecture video, and given how much people fly, I would have never guessed that the fashion industry would even come close to those two. And to this day I still can’t even believe that the average American throws out 68 pieces of clothing per year. I don’t think I’ve ever even owned 68 pieces of clothing at a time, certainly not in my adult life. What I also thought was interesting, and what I had referenced in a reply last week in regards to “Walden”, was the notion of green-washing. The link again for anybody who would like to read it: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ex7t3m/hm_accused_of_greenwashing_over_plans_to_make/
        <br><br>
This article brought up how companies like H&M are using this method of green-washing to appear more environmentally friendly, and how they are only contributing more to the problem by misleading their consumers. Not to mention them and other companies intentionally burying information in reports, offering discounts for people to recycle their clothing when it just ends up burned in a country like Africa anyways, or releasing vague and confusing commercials on how “green” and “eco friendly” they are. It is insane how they get away with all of this. These companies should be punished for what they do, and not just in fines because they certainly make enough money for a fine to barely make a dent in their profits. I don’t know how exactly they should be held accountable, but they need to be. And it could be as simple as people just don’t buy clothes from them anymore, but with how massive and popular they are, that option seems unlikely.

The film, “The True Cost,” discusses the dangers of the fashion industry--such as the life-threatening conditions sweatshop workers work in and the negative environmental impacts. Clothing companies source their labor in third-world countries in order to cut costs and maximize profits. These workers are exploited by these wealthy clothing companies by working for a tiny wage and in dangerous conditions. Excessive consumerism and the “fast fashion” industry only fuel people’s suffering. Not only that, but the chemicals used to grow materials for fabric can bleed into the environment and give children mental and physical defects. The film documented this by showing the viewers the mentally and physically handicapped children whose conditions were caused by these chemicals. I really hope the conditions for the garment workers change, but I feel somewhat doubtful about it because I know that the major clothing companies are too selfish to change their ways and will continue to exploit them to maximize their profit margins.

Consumption demand is actually a kind of propaganda stimulus, and the use value is converted into reproduction capital. GDP is only reflected in the value of the commodity economy, and ignores the inherent natural economic value. The short-term superficial prosperity of the commodity economy comes at the cost of double damage to the natural economy. Low cost relies on the constant migration of the labor market to avoid cost responsibility. The problem of the clothing industry's commercial chain is actually the epitome of the globalization problem brought about by the new free economic system. The leather industry not only cripples animals, but also causes great pollution to the environment. I should have empathy for this matter, but I didn't think much about it. In the future, pay more attention and try not to buy leather products. Think about it, in fact, most leather products are not necessary: ​​shoes, bags, belts etc. are all accessories and are not irreplaceable. Left-behind children are not a unique problem in China, and the causes are inseparable from industrialization and urbanization. Fast-selling products are not good for anyone: front-line workers are constantly squeezed to reduce prices; low-cost cotton, dyes, and materials extracted from the petroleum industry each cause harm to the environment and employees during the production process; In fact, it is often vaguely designed to adapt to various body shapes. As a result, consumers often don't look good on the body. In addition, the quality is poor, and they will not wear it once or twice. In fact, it causes a lot of trouble. Most of them were thrown into garbage dumps, which could not be degraded for two hundred years, or sold to the third world, and the garbage dumps that ended up in the third world still could not be degraded for two hundred years. The only benefit in this process It is capitalists.

After watching the “Ugly Cost of Fast Fashion” I felt guilty not because I’m a big consumer of fast fashion but because my other is in the fast fashion business and I’ve taken everything that I’ve gotten from the income of fast fashion that my father makes. Now I know how horrible it’s impacting not just people but the earth as well. He’s obviously not a huge corporate company but he’s not making it any better if anything he’s making it worse by joining this and he’s been doing this for over 20 years. It’s my responsibly to educate my dad on what he’s doing and make sure he finds other options on how he makes the clothes and to be more attentive to how and where it’s made. Hassan made it clear that fast fashion is ruining us. We’re making more clothes that we can wear and so much of this clothes is gone to waste and damaging the planet. I have the opportunity in helping by educating my father and I won’t let it be wasted.

These two films both focus on the topic that how fast fashion can be harmful to our environment. Both films are effective at communicating its subject by 1) showing the poor working conditions of third-world workers, they are being put on a position that is inhumane, I can feel their painful emotions and hopelessness because they have no choice; 2) showing how fast fashion impacted our environment for making its own greatest profits and caused serious environmental problems such as polluted water, air, and soils; 3) letting us know the true cost of buying clothes is way more "expensive" than we think, the tons of clothes we are producing are undecomposable, and the clothes we are donating eventually go back to those developing countries who made them, which form a vicious circle, and we need to change it. As I keep on watching, I’m getting more and more shocked by the people and environment that is affected. I feel like I’m being selfish and I was thinking in a narrow way, when I buy a cloth I didn’t think once where or how did it come from, and where will it be after I donate it, there are so many consequences I didn’t consider before. It is cruel that the happy life of developed countries is drinking blood from some developing countries. After watching this film, my attitude towards buying clothes changed a lot, I used to follow fashion bloggers blindly, buy what they buy to make myself look pretty, always thinks that I don’t have anything to wear even though my closet is actually filled with clothes. I will try to minimize my costs on clothes in the future and think twice before buying them.

The subject of this film was communicated effectively by touching deeply upon the emotions of its viewers. This film included interviews with those directly endangered by the fashion industry, as well as the few with a goal of dismantling our current system. Such interviews bring viewers to the human side of the industry by being able to connect with such individuals; Their passion for igniting change in a seemingly unchanging system is translated clearly. By showing the dichotomy between the consumers and those creating products to be consumed, the dangers of our current system of fast fashion and throw-away goods is evident. One of the most poignant moments in this film was the transition between screaming consumers, scrambling to grab as many items as possible during a Black Friday sale, and footage of Shima, a Bangledeshi woman in her home, alone with her child. These images, despite their striking contrast, are both depictions of human beings, likely with wishes for themselves and their families. The carelessness of consumerism is clearly a detriment to Shima, as she expresses her wish for her daughter to grow up successfully, not working in a garment factory. At the same time, the same system that is driving Shima and her daughter apart is considered the norm to Black Friday shoppers, who are oblivious to the dangers of fast fashion, which hurt individual workers and our environment as a whole. This film shatters the bubble of ignorance surrounding fast fashion and exposes big fashion companies for their manipulation of consumers and lack of concern for the people that make their products.

The 68 pieces of clothing number is what really caught my eye. It just made me realize how poor I am. I can’t afford to buy a new article of clothing every weak but hey at least it’s better for the planet that I can’t. I generally wear my clothes for a long while and I guess I can be proud of that now. However something that I’ve been doing wrong is clothes donating. Whenever I didn’t need clothes anymore I would pile them up and then donate them the next day. However i didn’t know anything about how much of these donated clothes end actually being sold. A lot of these clothes end up being burned to sold to some other vendor. Luckily my family isn’t on the whole fast fashion craze but I have had friends who would spend their entire paycheck on a shopping spree and I could never understand why. I never knew that shopping could be addicting but it totally makes sense. It fulfills our the consumer needs that are engraved in our minds since we were kids. It allows us to fulfill the scripts and aspirations that society has set up for us even if it’s just for little while until the next trend comes along. But as pointed out by the Patriot Act video, fast fashion isn’t sustainable. Creating clothes pollutes with their chemicals and costs so much water to create. No matter how much these companies want to brand themselves as sustainable, they’re not. There has to be something done to change the fast fashion craze for the sake of our planet.

Out of all the films I really took to this film, because of my personal interest in clothing and the fashion industry. I used to be a very clothing shopper, only buying things that I really liked, without really considering where the garment may have come from or all the factors that went into producing it from the materials to the hard conditions that laborers have to endure. To learn that 97% of all clothing is outsourced from countries still in the developing stages and that workers are paid a mere $3 an hour was horrifying. It’s made me reconsider the future places I’m going to shop at and to try and change my mentality entirely and perhaps try something like thrift shopping to fulfill my clothing needs. Not only did it seem like, from the conditions the workers were in, that it was an environmental justice problem, but also a flat out breach on the general safety that these workers should’ve been provided especially considering that laboring work that they do day in and day out.

I also was very drawn to this film from my interest in the clothing and fashion industry. Never before have I really thought about where the clothes that I purchase might have come from, along with the people who stitched them together. Up until last year, my mindset always revolved around what I wanted my style to be and how I would feel in the clothes I seek out to buy and wear. Last fall, I took my first Global Studies class which focused on international economic and political processes (and history). The interplay between the economy and the environment was always the main focus that the class and lecturer accounted for. Segments on industrial outsourcing, global value chains, and labor division utilized the clothing, fashion, and textile industry as a prime example. The developed world (global north) and its exploitation of the developing world, especially by means of labor and resources, is one of the most pressing and common themes of interaction on the international stage today (and throughout history). Specifically, the Rana Plaza incident in Bangladesh was one of the most tragic examples of this universal economic cycle and norm resulting in disaster.

The True Cost reopened my eyes to this cross-sectional issue that also has its negative implications for the environment and in the climate crisis. This is not only a social, economic, and political issue, it is a very important environmental issue. Thrifting and alternative means of fashion and clothing are very enjoyable and exciting approaches to this problem, and I think more and more people are becoming drawn to it. Looking forward, it is going to be important for me to maintain an awareness of my decisions and active role within this cycle. I hope I can keep diligence in my consumer decisions (especially involving fashion and clothing).

What really opened my eyes up after watching "The True Cost" was the situation of the Rana Plaza, I was aware that a lot of factory practices over by a lot of 3rd world countries and China were not humane at all, but just seeing the videos of Rana Plaza, the dead bodies, the families hoping their loved one is fine, is absolutely mortifying. How is any of this okay?! How come none the of big fast fashion industries are apologizing to that terrible event?! "We do not own that factory, so it is not our responsibility", I'm sorry but screw you. This made me so angry, so sad, so infuriated because of the lack of human morals and decency there is in the fast fashion industry. You, big corporations, are killing us off one by one, and yet that death toll, that blood on the clothes you are selling, does not bother you? Is the fast fashion industry just our Hell now? It just hurts to see many of these workers being under paid, being abused, being basically slaves for the American economy, and yet we do not do anything about it. This is one of the many reasons I try my best to not buy stuff from big name corporations like H&M and Macy's, but even as I try, I fall into their hands whenever I need to buy a quick pair of leggings or sweats because I used mine way too much and they are beyond repair,

        <br><br>

What shocked me the most was what happened to many of the donated items if they never been sold to anyone; just given away to places like Haiti for the people to buy and get. But the huge problem is that they have too many clothes too, so where does it go? To the waste. This just blew my mind, for years my mother and I have donated so many clothes to our Salvation Army, to our Goodwill, to Cancer patients who needed them, yet our stuff that we have donated may have landed in the dumps this entire time. It hurts, it really does. I thought I was HELPING by donating my old shirts and pants that I have used for years to those who would need it, yet I may be fueling to the problem of the huge landfills. I always felt nice, proud, and happy when I donate my old clothes to charity, because I have always believed that someone out there is going to use it and love it, yet I never thought about my heartfelt donation being used to harm someone else, let alone our planet.

Watching this film really opened my eyes more than any other movie so far on how the actions that we everyday capitalist consumers affect those around the world. The undermining nature of the big businesses and corporations really struck an emotional cord within me. I've been to see consumerism as a pyramid scheme in itself to where all the money flows to the top. But when it comes to the negative effects on the people, it gets flipped on its head, with all of the problems trickling down as the money flows up. I myself believe that fast fashion and rampant consumerism is unfavorable to me. Whatever those big brands and social media tell me to wear, doesn't affect me in my spending habits. This movie however, makes me look deeper into every physical item that I purchase and how it affects not just those that I know it affects, but everyone in the process as well. The big point in the issue with how the clothing consumer market came to be is most definitely social media. Brands are able to advertise through large influencers and sell them whatever the brand wants to sell.

While watching the film "The True Cost" I had a very emotional response. Seeing all of the lives that are affected because of peoples' unnecessary need for the newest clothes was incredibly heartbreaking. I feel like this film did a great job of showing just how damaging and harmful the fast fashion industry truly is and of explaining that just because the prices drop, does not mean that the cost does too. Before seeing this film I had no idea how much our actions as consumers affected people on the other side of the world, and that is the case for most Americans. It is scary to think that these big companies are able to keep all of this terrifying information from us so that we remain loyal consumers. More people should definitely watch this film to be made aware of how harmful our actions can be, because this is not right. If anything like this was happening in any primarily white country then everyone would be freaking out, but since it is happening to people of color, we are somehow all okay with it. When the film showed clips of American news anchors talking about these issues such as low incomes or unsafe working environments in the fast fashion, I was shocked when they spoke about it as if the topic was a joke. This film really made me think about how it seems like all of the problems of the world are connected by the same types of people, for example how this film shows how the fast fashion industry is not only horrible for the environment, but is also racist. These corporations are treating human lives like they mean nothing and it is horrifying.

Society today encourages the consumption of fast fashion and almost frowns upon those who do not follow these trends. After watching the True Cost, in ENG 22 last year I was disappointed in myself for allowing society’s  expectations to sway my consumer purchases. However, I feel as though one has to be really dedicated to not give in to these temptations. Especially since I am a part of greek life on campus, I feel as though new clothing items are always needed to match a certain theme, or a new dress has to be bought for this quarter's date party and so on and so forth. Sure, it is easy to commit to buying less and monitoring your consumption of fast fashion, but the pressure placed on people, especially women, in today’s society to dress accordingly has an immense impact on this industry. While, obviously, it is hard to work with what you are given, I feel as though the main way I combat these pressures is through borrowing clothes. Instead of going out and buying something I will wear once on occasion, I’ll ask my roommates or friends if they have anything I can borrow, which definitely strengthens your relationships with the people around you while avoiding the environmental impact of consuming fast fashion.

In response to the video, “The Ugly Cost of Fast Fashion”, I appreciated how Hasan Minhaj used comedy to relay the message of how toxic the fast fashion industry is to the environment. The one segment that really stood out to me was the pop up store he made, in which he stole the designs and even the name of a company, to emphasize how immoral these industries production and management policies are. I found it extremely sickening how designers, who put weeks worth of hours into designing one piece, can be ripped off by brands like Fashion Nova, or H&M in a matter of days with no repercussions. Seeing as there is copyright for music, television, and other innovative products it shocks me that there is nothing protecting designers. Furthermore, I became frustrated with how brands are allowed to run an environmentally friendly fashion line, without having to actually be environmentally friendly. I would highly recommend this video to my friends because it opens people’s eyes to the truth of the fast fashion industry and goes even farther to show to how the consumption of these brands are harming the environment.

“The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” is a film that unveiled a terrible truth about the fast fashion industry. It illustrates the ruse that utilized by the clothes industry to attract people to buy their products. According to the book “the waste makers”, firms change three aspects of their products, quality, function, and desirability, to lure people to buy more stuff and discard stuff, which is called consumerism. Producing clothes will cost lots of water and fossil fuel, and during the production of clothes, lots of CO2 is emitted into the atmosphere. CO2 emissions have increased a lot accompanied with the fast fashion industry. Not like fashion firms like Tommy Hilfiger, H&M and Zara make knockoff, which is clothes look like celebrities wore but with lower prices, to lure people to consume more. In addition, Zara and H&M come out of new fashion every week instead of every season. Since the fast fashion industry took place, there is more waste than before. People will discard old clothes if they buy a new one. However, only a small part of the clothes is donated to poor people, and most of them are burned and buried. Moreover, H&M maintains that its products are eco-friendly and people can get a discount if they return the old clothes. Nevertheless, it is a strategy that makes people consume more. The methods that they use to dispose the old clothes are also burning and burying.
            <br><br>
  After watching this film, I contemplate my lifestyle and plan to consume less. Just like Thoreau, I will buy a few sturdy clothes. It is not necessary to buy so many clothes that most of them will not be worn in one’s lifetime. If everyone can change their lifestyle, the climate crisis will be mitigated in the future.

In watching "The True Cost," what I find most important about the film is the we get to see and learn about individual stories and how the consumer culture affects the life of sweatshop workers and others. I find this film similar to "Before the Flood," because it includes people's stories and how their life is altered due to the climate crisis and its contributing factors like fast fashion. In "Before the Flood," one example was Kiribati, where sea level rises have had devastating causes to individual homes, to the point where people do not have a place to live. In this week's film, we learn about the poor working conditions of the people in places including Bangladesh and the demands of the fashion industry. We also see the protests in Cambodia for higher wages, and Kanpur where people labor in the leather production. In watching this film, we see the side of the fashion industry that is not really talked about. How many times do people wonder who produced what they are wearing? Whose hands were behind the sewing machine that created your pink sweater? We are to busy worrying about what we are going to wear and how cheap it will cost that we do not consider the possibility of reaching out to these communities and start caring about their lifestyle and health. 
            <br><br>
Overall, I find it important that this film includes people who work in sweatshops and other places. By watching this, we get to consider where we stand as consumers and to what extent our consumption continues to have an impact on the life of others. These people work for their families under exploitation while hoping for better working conditions. In America, we don't see the true cost. Instead we get to purchase cheap products and not consider who produces what or under which conditions. What if this were to change, if instead of not acknowledging the life of others, we start to change our selfish desires and reach out.

"The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" was one of the best ways to showcase the gluttony that is fast fashion. I have always believed that comedy is one of the best ways to discuss serious subjects because it can catch the eye of someone who wouldn't normally care or watch something about them, and it makes it easier to digest. John Oliver is a wonderful example of this, but Hasan Minhaj did a great job as well. This is the sort of video I could send a friend who isn't that worried about the environment, and they could watch it, without being bored or finding it preachy. It may even change their minds. The use of a knock off store was a great way to pull in consumers and educate them. The piles of clothes created memorable imagery. It was overall a very good video. (Even if you watched The True Cost for this week, seriously, watch this as well.)
            <br><br>
Not to be super serious or anything, but I am extremely worried about the young girls who are being prepped by the cosmetics industry. When I was in high school, I couldn't go a day without a full face of makeup, even when I was just hanging with my best friends, or going to a waterpark (what was I thinking?). I was addicted, and I built my self-worth off of that. It took a while, but eventually, I noticed my unhealthy dependence on makeup. Over time, I cut it down, and now I can go weeks without wearing any. Now, I grew up in a slightly less cosmetics-obsessed time. I wasn't inundated with makeup tutorials until middle school or later. However, my young cousin was less lucky. She is 6 years old, and for Christmas this year she asked for "real makeup". With Youtube becoming a large part of children's entertainment, kids are starting to think they need to do this so much earlier. I don't want younger girls to grow up with the same self-image issue I had. I don't want anyone to.

I also enjoyed the format of "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion", the host kept me both engaged and entertained at the same time. I like the fact that not only did he have a heavily informational section of the video, but he also had a section that was like a social experiment to demonstrate the horrors of fast fashion to the regular public. I think it is critical to try experimental ways like this video to attract a bigger audience and spread the message better. 
            <br><br>
The cosmetic industry is honestly very harmful to young women in creating its own definition of beauty. This relates to the reading we had this week that companies are purposefully creating advertisements to mentally distort the consumer into thinking they constantly need their new products.

The film "The true cost" was a major eye-opener to the reality of how third world country factories are and how much pressure there is on these producers. Workers are stuck in factories for long hours every day in which there are no safety standards with possibilities of machines malfunctioning, buildings collapsing, and toxic fumes being exposed everywhere. These horrible working conditions sprout from the pressure of first world countries' consumer culture continuously pushing prices to be cheaper and cheaper, and for products to become cheaper cuts need to be made somewhere. These cuts are made at the manufacturer level and burden low paid workers. The overwhelming demand for cheap goods that will probably be thrown out 4 months after they are sold is so bountiful that there is no room to make wages higher, form unions, or look into work safety, it is just produce, produce and produce. With these extremely cheap labor wages, American consumers must be profiting greatly, well sadly it's not as much as expected. As noted in the film, while Americans still have great access to a wide variety of cheap goods, the majority of profits go to corporate business owners who are racking in ridiculous amounts of money for their own personal well being. These as well are the same people who say they do not feel bad about sweatshop workers as they are "supplying them with a job". While this is true, it is no excuse to give them inhumane working conditions and extremely low wages. 
            <br><br>


Our whole system of fast-paced consumerism needs to change as it is hurting humans, hurting the planet, and only helping corporate business owners. Action from consumers need to be taken to value quality over quantity in their products in order to alter the general consumer demand so suppliers and businesses can respond in a new form that doesn't include 52 fashion seasons a year, and horrible work safety tragedies overseas.

After watching “The True Cost”, I feel angry and guilty. Before watching the film, I never realize that our pursuit of fashion and low prices could become selfishness that kills hundreds and thousands of people from poor areas. The film reminds me of what I have learnt in Global 2 class. After hyper globalization, many companies have their supply chains around the world. They desire low cost for their products so that they could earn more profit, and thus a “race to the bottom” effect has emerged. The factory that offers the lowest price to produce the product gets the business, so factories squeezes their cost by giving low wages and poor working conditions, not even the workers safety can be secured. Looking at the Rana Plaza disaster, even though workers have reported that there are cracks on factory walls, the manager doesn’t seem to care about this problem. It’s like, they are not seeing the workers as human, but machines that keeps on generating profit for them, and if there are risks that might damage their “profiting machines” they would simply ignore the risk and let the “machines” keeps on working to get them as much profit as possible before the whole thing collapses. 
            <br><br>
There are many accidents due the poor condition of working and the poor regulation, like the Bhopal gas leak, which not only released large amount of methyl isocyanate gas, which is a highly toxic substance, but also killed more than 8000 thousand people, caused more than 570,000 injuries, and another 8000 deaths related to disease caused by the gases. Similarly, there has been small leaks before the disaster, but was simply ignored. Children workers has been seen in Nike; Shell spilled more than 1500 barrels of oil into the Nigeria Delta... The lack of regulation in supply chains has always been a huge problem. The companies are of course to blame for pursuing profit without consider about safety of people. However, if we could stop the consumerism lifestyle that provides the rationale for the companies to blindly search for profit, thing should be a lot different.

Watching “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” was very enjoyable to me. Hasan brought comedy to such a harsh but true reality to many Americans. Fast fashion is harming our environment at an alarming rate and people in the United States are allowing this because we are a society obsessed with buying the new and latest fashion trend right when it comes out. Even though a new trend has surfaced where it is cool to buy clothes from a thrift shop, it has opened up a new market for “high end” thrift stores where you can buy a thrifted item but at much higher prices than say a Goodwill or Salvation Army store which is still good, but what happens if this trend is to ever go out of style? We need to take some serious action to demand that the fashion industry change their harmful fossil-fueled practices and switch to other ones that require less use of oil and water and less cutting down forests just in the name of fashion. Hiltner is right that we shouldn’t only be buying clothes made of synthetic material, and we should buy longer-lasting articles of clothing even if it is more expensive than we are used too. The United States needs to start turning away from Fast Fashion and go back to our roots with companies that have better environmentally friendly practices.

“The True Cost” by Andrew Morgan is a documentary that covers multiple problems caused by America’s clothing industry. By showing the devastation caused by the “fast fashion” in thirteen different countries, the documentary shows its audience the truth behind all the lush beauty and clothing commercials. After seeing how clothing industry workers are deplored, I changed my view on fast fashion. 
            <br><br>
We live in a world with uncontrolled consumerism and a total lack of understanding of the how our clothes are made.
            <br><br>
Not only is the fast fashion industry taking advantage of the factory workers, but they are also detrimental to our environment. The production of cotton takes a huge amount of water and pesticides. The disposal of clothing is also a huge problem due to the fast pace of fashion seasons and new trends.
            <br><br>
Overall, I think fast fashion plays a big row in the current environmental problems.

This film was a huge eyeopener to the other side of the fashion industry that is usually ignored. Although we are all aware that cheap fast fashion is manufactured in poorer countries and take advantage of workers that have to produce the clothes for disgustingly low wages, we still purchase the clothing with little to no guilt. The part that really sadden me was that when the workers tried to form a union and sent a list of demands to increase their working conditions, they were met with backlash and were beaten up. It is so terrifying that these human beings have to respect the owners of the company in order to keep their low-paying jobs and have to submit to their rules. Most of these workers have children as well and have to worry about their health since these factories have so much chemicals and are dangerous to the wellbeing of themselves and their children. The workers have severe health problems such as numbness in the limbs and boils on their skin, yet they cannot do anything about it since the consumers want more and the companies want to supply consumers with the products while trying to maximize their profit.
            <br><br>
If this isn't already enough reason to boycott these companies, there is also a huge factor on the environment that is created from the fast fashion industry. Pesticides are being released left and right from the sheer amount of cotton that needs to be grown in order to meet the demands of our consumer culture. Although there are safer and better ways to grow these products, companies find the cheapest way to cultivate them, and then make minimum wage workers manufacture the clothing with the material. As they say in the film, we need to remember that all the clothes we wear “are touched by human hands.” As consumers, we are ultimately in power of the lives that are affected by our actions. We should support companies that are eco-friendly and support workers with healthy working environments and give them a living wage, and boycott companies that do not do so. Although this is definitely hard since the major brands that are popular (Nike, etc) all participate in these acts, we have to be more aware as consumers to make better choices.

This week’s video made me very sad for two reasons. The first reason was that I never really realized how poorly “sweatshop workers” have it. Clothing companies, such as Forever 21 and H&M, keep dishing out new clothing every week at lower and lower prices. Although this may seem like a positive for those who are looking for stylish and inexpensive clothing, this has terrible impacts on sweatshops and working conditions in places such as Bangladesh. These sweatshops have two choices: either work for less money because these companies want to sell their products for less money or not have any business. Due to the fact that they are willing to work for as little money as possible, they have to cut corners somehow. They do this by not following safety regulations and having poor and hostile working conditions. These rich companies are making so much money yet they can not guarantee the safety of these workers? Some of these workers are kids! 1000 unfortunate kids lost their lives due to the terrible clothing industry. The second reason why this video made me sad is that I am part of the problem. I often buy clothes that I do not need solely due to the price. Going onwards, I need to be more conscientious when I make any purchase, as every purchase has a backstory.

Hasan Minhaj's "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" segment was as funny as it was informative. It is truly sad to see the state of affairs in the world's fashion industry. Fast-fashion brands are leading the pack in adding waste and pollution to our environment. The fashion industry (or clothes-buying in general) is a vicious cycle. There were many horrible truths that Minhaj talked about in regard to the fashion industry.  While I do not shop at H&M or Zara, it is unsettling to see that they don't really seem to know how to respond to the climate crisis. It honestly doesn't even look like they care. Their "conscious" and "live life" eco-lines are just there to save face. 

            <br><br>

Developing countries seem to not catch a break in this climate crisis. They are the dumping ground for much of our fashion waste, in addition to many other wastes that we send their way. It is truly disheartening to see how some people from developing countries even offer to buy our old clothes just to open them up and find them un wearable. A lot of donated clothing also just ends up either in the incinerator or landfill.

The film "True Cost" was really upsetting to watch. I've known about sweatshops and the issue with fast fashion, but it was a whole other thing to see the effects on the people having to make the clothes we wear. It was even more heartbreaking to see innocent children suffering from a multitude of health issues because of the toxins being put into the environment, and to see women working in these brutal conditions in order to support themselves and their families while companies profit is absolutely ridiculous. I hate to say that I have definitely contributed to the continuation of fast fashion and the film really did open my eyes to why I need to think about ways to reduce my involvement with fast fashion.

Having already watched the "True Cost," I instead turned to observe "The Ugly Cost of Fashion." I've always heard good things about the Patriot Act, but have never gotten around to watching it on my own, so I'm actually quite glad that this was a mandatory assignment. Hasan Minhaj covers many of the same issues as the "True Cost" does, however he presents it with a side of ironic humor, our generations means of coping with the devastation of the world. There's always something to be said for the communicative abilities of humor, there's always a bit of a deeper connection when you can laugh about the things that genuinely make us quite sad. 
            <br><br>


Something I found particularly interesting was how many companies can claim something is "green" or "eco-friendly," but in truth there's no meaning behind these labels. It's rather similar to the concept of something being "organic" in the food industry, but the fact that nothing is actually tested in being "organic" means the word holds no merit at all. It really just goes to show how manipulative these companies are, making promises just because it benefits their image and never upholding any of them. 

            <br><br>

The multitude of seasons that don't even exist is just so astounding and unnecessary. The mass amount of clothes the average American produces and doesn't even use, flabbergasting. It doesn't seem like they're letting up either, as operating under the guise of being environmentally sound will make those unaware of the harm brush it under the rug. It's good that Macklemore was onto the right track, as Hasan mentions, as thrifting needs to become more popular in order to begin hindering the outrageous hurt fast fashion is wreaking on the environment.



</p><hr>


<p>

I think informing people about mass consumption would be more effective in ways similar to how Hasan Minhaj speaks about it in Patriot Act. Although  I think documentaries give a more in-depth view of the effects of overconsumption of clothing, adding a bit of humor and making something shorter tends to get viewers' attention better. Obviously, rampant consumerism is no laughing matter, but Hasan Minhaj appropriately and successfully uses comedic tactics when seriously explaining the problems of fast fashion; he gets the point across that certain companies who use fast fashion tactics are negatively contributing to consumers' spending habits and the environment. I think the blend between comedy and real information in regards to fast fashion work when presenting it to an audience; this method should become more popular to effectively make people more aware of the problems clothing companies and consumers are creating for the earth.

            <br><br>

Regarding whose fault rampant consumerism is, I think corporations and consumers both play a role; however, corporations make a bigger impact on this issue. With advertisements essentially anywhere we look, it is hard to blame just the people buying products on why overconsumption is a reality. Our mindsets are molded to think that materialistic items are very important in our lives because of marketing tactics from the beginning of our life onward. As Ken mentioned in this video, television advertisements are tailored to children on kids' channels; already suggesting to people at a very young age that materialism is an important facet in our lives. I think the biggest effect advertising has on an audience is when the ad markets a lifestyle associated with a product, instead of marketing what the actual product does/provides. This phenomenon is most eminent in the clothing industry. Often times, people buy specific brands because of the logo or how much it costs, not because of what it legitimately offers as a product. A mentioned in Patriot Act, almost identical pieces of clothing are sold by Gucci, an expensive designer brand, as they are sold by Zara, an inexpensive brand. Corporations lead the charge in making rampant consumerism what it is, but consumers themselves need to make a change so that these greedy companies will implode.

"The True Cost" is a film that examines the fashion industry and its impacts on us and the Earth. It under covers the scenes behind the glamour and reveals its ugliness in the ongoing business. Fashion industries are the second largest polluter in the world. But most companies will continue to do satisfy our needs and will continue to bring more negative effects into our environment just to meet our needs as consumers. Companies that produce inexpensive clothing rapidly to follow the latest trends is known as fast fashion. Fast fashion makes shopping more affordable but it comes with an negative cost to our environment. It takes a lot to make those clothes, like using gallons of water or making cotton, a water intensive plant. And once the trend is over, those clothes are often dumped or wasted. What shocked me was that in the 1960s, the United States produced 95% of their clothing, but today it is only 3%. Many of us consumers are not aware of or don't care about the harmful consequences that come with purchasing clothes. If we change our consumption habits, this can have a big impact on reducing carbon footprints.

I have done some research on the fast-fashion industry before, especially on the tragedy happened in Bangladesh, but I was discussing the issue more from the perspective of worker exploitation, workplace safety, business ethics, laborers’ rights, and minimum wage etc. This is the first time I’m really looking at the fast-fashion industry as a problem of the environment. The fast fashion industry has been young people’s major shopping resources, including mine. It is indeed a great deal for teenagers and college students to purchase items that are in trend but at an affordable price, but this also results in a much faster purchase rate and disposing rate because the both the item’s “style” and quality can be obsolete very quickly and it wouldn’t hurt too much to discard a piece worth only $5. However, this movie illustrates how the fast-fashion industry by revealing how the fast fashion brands care only about minimizing their production cost and maximizing their profit and exploiting workers not only by paying them extremely low wages but also putting them in dangerous and risky workplace building. The chain of cotton farmer, fertilizer supplier, GM seed company, and local villages also shows how broad the fast fashion industry can influence the public. It is disheartening to watch the interviews of the leaders and members of the management team of the brands denying, avoiding to address the mistakes and negative effects they are making to people and the environment. 
            <br><br>


However, I think it is very hard to debunk the fast fashion culture as the internet is and will be more greatly accelerating the flow of information, meaning that people will still be very much persuaded by the colorful and fancy marketing of fast fashion items. I personally like the thrifting culture very much, although affected by YouTubers and influencers as well. I thrifted both online and in stores and found thrifting a fun thing to do. You have to look for the items you like patiently and when you do, it is like a surprising gift discovered accidentally. More importantly, it benefits both the buyers and the sellers as the former gets cheap items and the later can get rid of unwanted clothes for a cash back. I think it would be a good idea if more influencers start to introduce and recommend thrifting so that teenagers and young people can prefer thrifting than purchasing from brands like H&M and Zara more often.

What a crazy film to watch. Yes, I already knew about how detrimental fast fashion is to our environment, but seeing it in this light opened my eyes even more. I'm already a huge fan of buying clothes second hand, and most of my clothes do come from this method, but I am very guilty of hopping on Amazon and buying unnecessary things out of convenience. The convenience and speed of getting things through fast fashion is NOT an excuse or justification for how poorly these workers are treated by these companies. With such long hours and terrible working conditions, you would think there would be some benefits. Instead, these workers are tirelessly making garments that cost $6 to manufacture but are being sold for $75+. Absolutely disgusting and these companies should be ASHAMED that they exploit people like this.
            <br><br>
We have been seeing a pattern in all these big companies: they all put their greed before the Earth and its inhabitants. I don't think this will ever change. People at the top of these companies are too rich to care about what the impacts are, and people working in sweatshops and too desperate for work that they don't have an option to stop working for their disgusting, exploiting companies. As individuals, we can support local and handmade companies, do clothing swaps with friends instead of buying new clothes out of boredom with our closets, and thrift shop more, where I promise you will find your new favorite pair of jeans for a fraction of the price.

After viewing the Andre Morgan’s “The True Cost,” I think I can
quite understand the connection into our own life. I am thinking about the
brand like Zara. All the products of zara cannot last for a long time, but it
is so cheap that all the people like the cheap price of it and it seems so “fashion,”
and makes them feel good. Also, the idea that the cosmetic company is not making
product, instead it is making consumers shocked me. The consequences of simply
watching an advertisement of cosmetics has this kind of huge influences and even
changed the mind of a little girl for the future. The consumerism relates so
many problems, even relates to the problems of children employment, so this
idea leads me to think that If we can solve this problem, we may save the planet.

The information presented in "The True Cost" was shocking to me.  The US government is allowing American companies to outsource jobs to sweatshops in third world countries in order to underpay and mistreat individuals that do not have the same rights as US citizens.  It shocked me how horrible the conditions are when million dollar companies can afford to take care of their workers in the third world countries, but choose not to out of interest of fighting for every bit of money they can get.  The Rana Plaza Disaster and Bangladesh fires killing thousands of workers should be a sign for the US government to do something, but the US has been letting large corporations get away with most things over recent years.  The US has slacked on anti-trust issues and on trying to balance the economic system (so small businesses are able to compete), allowing large conglomerations and consolidations to form.   There are plenty of incentives to regulate these industries.  It has now become a question of human rights, competitive prices and promotion of small businesses (which politicians claim to be the back bone of our economy), and now the environment.  It's interesting to see how long the US is going to let that list of problems grow before they see the need to regulate these companies as essential.  However, as seen by the disinformation campaign against Climate Change scientists, companies are able to spill money into influencing the public opinion and lobbying in congress in order to combat legislation that goes against their interest.

True Cost hit me on so many levels. I know this comment can do my anger and passion nearly enough justice but I will try. I will admit I cried four separate times during this documentary, and these emotions made me feel so alive it was actually crazy. First of all, I was bewildered that as late as the 1960s 95% of clothes were still made in the US and as of today under 3% are and 97% are pushed to developing countries. Okay doesn’t seem so bad at first. We just want cheaper labor, right? Well, this cheapness of fashion products come at a huge cost, the cost of lives, security, happiness, and basic rights around the globe. Ranza Plaza, where 1131 innocent workers lost their lives, is a perfect example of why capitalism is, and has since its creation, always finds shortcuts and causes immense human suffering and exploitation of some for profit and wealth for a handful few. The saddest part about this capitalist massacre is that these workers were complaining! Complaining that the cracks in the walls were dangerous, that the chemicals in the factory were unsafe, that the infrastructure was unsound. Nobody listened to them. Why? Well instead of putting money to make safe working conditions for cheap laborers, you could be spending that money in another country developing more clothes. We see companies taking short cuts that cost lives in so many instances for the sake of profit, from PG&E deciding not to turn of their power or update their old systems causing the campfire, to Ranza Plaza and not fixing building that could kill thousands, to giving farmer’s such impossible to meet payments for land that “farmer suicides” is now real and kills one farmer every 30 min. Capitalism is flawed in that throughout history it has always been done, the profit motive and that being the highest value makes people’s humanity and morality get tossed aside. And here’s the problem with keeping capitalism: if one company decided to be moral, give their workers fair conditions, listen to their complaints, and work to make real good change, they are going to get outcompeted by the other companies that screw their workers but get cheaper labor. It is a lose lose for humanity, or as one lady says in the documentary a win win for companies and a loss for nature and loss for humanity. The Ranza Plaza incident points out another flaw in capitalism: the need to work to ‘survive’. THese workers have no power, they can’t leave their job if their conditions aren’t met or they literally will die. Humans should have a right to life irregardless of whether they are working or not, because companies take advantage of this fact that they need to have a job and use it to not allow the workers to have any democratic power. We live in a corporate dictatorship. It is disgusting and immoral. My point being we need to take a look at the culture and values of capitalism as a whole because if any company decided to practice correct laws and be moral they will be driven out of business by those who act immorally but make more profit. 
            <br><br>
 This documentary has completely changed my relationship to buying clothes. I have bought so many tank tops from china and now I can only imagine what the creation of those cheap tanks I buy must have been like. These are really people deeply suffering for items we don’t actually need. I am making a deep commitment to go into a minimalist lifestyle especially with clothes, and my mom and I (since she is taking this class too) are really going to only purchase clothes from environmentally and socially just companies. 
            <br><br>
A point that really stood out to me in the documentary was that Tim Kasser was a speaker on it! I have been a long fan of Tim Kasser’s work in the past year. In Johan Har’s book Lost Connections: The Real Causes of Depression and Anxiety and the Unexpected Solutions, he mentions studies by Tim Kasser that show that the more extrinsically motivated we are, like if we care about money, status, image, etc, the less happy and the more anxious and depressed we are. Tim Kasser mentions something similar in the documentary, that the more material focused we are the less happy we are. So this is a lose lose for us. Our option to have and go through 60 pairs of clothes a year (hence 52+ cycles now a days) not only steals the freedom of workers in developing countries to have a job that pays them a living wage and the freedom for them to be safe at work and freely protest, it is making us so much less happy as well.On top of that, our obsession with consumption and buying stuff is wreaking havoc on the climate and the fashion industry  is the #2 polluter behind fossil fuels!. Tim Kasser has also shown that capitalistic values undermine our ability to form close relationships and care about helping the broader world. THis is key for climate change as well. When focusing on profit, we psychologically Tim Kasser has shown are limited in our ability to care about the broader world, like helping those who will be most impacted by climate change.

In the film "The true cost" I was reminded that climate change isn't completely due to select problems like deforestation and others. Clothing is such a huge part of many peoples lives. We need it everyday. There are thousands of brands and styes and everything. It is crazy how right I my face it all is but how much I was unaware of the problem. The consumer mentality of buying right when we see something we may like or a good price is bad. It is real bad. Advertisements are now even better because they can know your preferences and find ways to narrow ads towards your interests and get you to buy more junk that you do not even need. Furthermore, we buy items from other countries. Although we may be getting a cheaper price or something, they must ship those items to the U.S. Either by plane or by boa, these items are sent across the world just destroying the climate so people can get a 10 dollar shirt of thing they wont use after two times. I enjoy thrifting clothes when I need new items. You can find good clothes that are cheap but that are going to be reused instead of buying new ones and contribution to the loads of junk already in circulation. I believe there need to be a large change in the consumer fashion society where we do not buy anything that comes to mind that we do not need.

"The True Cost" brought so much attention to the consequences of a free capitalistic system. So many people are abused for the sheer profit of big corporations. I hate to see the suffering of poor communities from the pure disregard of human rights. I still, however, believe it is the fault of our own (American) people that led to this demise. I don't see a heavy correlation between advertisements and propaganda, as one was strictly enforced and the other is just modern marketing. We do have the choice to accept or deny these companies from profit just from what we choose to buy. We are the ones who truly enable these companies to flourish in sins. Even then, these large companies should still be held accountable for their actions against humans. It is up to us ultimately to end their actions through voting, boycotting, and speaking out. In a capitalist society, it's the customers that dictate companies' actions and is never the other way around.

After watching "The True Cost," I learned that companies in the fashion industry are bringing and will continue to bring more detrimental effects to our environment because of all the tactics behind the operation of big brand clothing companies. It is true that the fashion industry has improved in regards to bringing satisfaction (time, material, and etc) to the customers. However, in order to bring this satisfaction, the industry has been producing so many damages on our planet. For example, planting large amounts of cotton usually needs abundant amounts of pesticides on our land. This specific example demonstrates how the customers' and the fashion industry's needs are bringing threats to our environment while pursuing capitalistic needs. However, this is not the only example that is being carried out for big brand companies in order to achieve great success and popularity. Many customers are unaware (or maybe don't care) about these issues and constantly purchase unnecessary amount of clothes every single day. Unfortunately , I myself have fallen into these unhealthy patterns without knowing the consequences it can bring to my planet. Therefore, I believe people should figure out and carry out certain ways that can help our planet while purchasing th clothes that are necessary. Recycling clothes are absolutely a great idea since it won't be like wasting our items to the point where we put more burden on our environment. I hope people can learn and truly see what is better for not only our futures but also our planet's.

While watching The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion, I was not surprised to find out that people buy way more clothes now than ever before. I know a lot of people that shop at some of these stores that go there often to buy the next new thing. Fast fashion makes people feel like they need to buy new clothing items all the time to fit in with everyone else. These stores basically have 52 seasons a year instead of 3 or 4 yearly, since they get new clothing items once a week. Social media is one of the reasons people buy so many different clothes. People want to post pics of them on their instagrams but do not want to use the same outfit that was on another post so they buy different clothings. A lot of the time people only wear the clothing up to 3 times before they throw them out, because they either ripped or they don’t like them anymore. This is such a waste of clothing and material. I used to shop at Forever 21, but I quickly stopped when I realized that they were also a part of fast fashion and their clothes did not last a long time. A lot of the clothes I bought from there were ripped after a few uses so I started to shop from other stores that have higher quality clothing.

I genuinely cannot put into words how I feel after watching the film "The True Cost". Appalled, horrified, defeated, disgusted- are all words that come to mind, but barely scrape the surface of emotion. Out of the many facts presented in the film, the number that stuck out to me above all others was 250,000. 250,000 farmer suicides. 1 every 30 minutes, and by the literal poison put forth on them by the metaphorical poisons of their livelihoods no less. One suicide is bad enough- as someone who lost a family member to it, I could spend hours talking about just the pain of one. But you start talking about hundreds of thousands all undeniably catalyzed by unawareness and the American’s refusal to criticize our economy, and you can’t help but begin to question literally everything. How can we be concerned about things so fickle as fashion when the foundations of our most basic systems are so clearly detrimental? These systems, this capitalist economy we have in place are on a timer- at some point I have to believe they will crumble to the ground no differently than the factory in Bangladesh they created. The resources we use so carelessly will run out, the people we have so little regard for will rebel and make us regard them, the earth that we treat so terribly for these purposes will treat us terribly in return. I for one, am terrified.

The film "True Cost" shows both sides of clothing production and consumption. It highlights the toll that consumerism has taken on the environment. Ken states that although corporations blame the consumers; we should never forget the nature of these companies. 
            <br><br>


I believe that the United States, in particular, has a problem with consumerism. After reading about minimalistic ways it is apparent that I may have an excess amount of clothes. Over time I will buy more and get rid of my old to companies like goodwill. In the future I would like to purchase less clothing but at a higher quality, that way it lasts longer and I have more satisfaction with it.

The only thing I could think of while watching "True Cost" was the vast difference between those people getting exploited for the consumerist culture of the U.S. and the biggest exemplars of that lifestyle. It was disgusting to see in my mind the "hypebeasts" and famous Youtube vloggers that are purely famous for throwing money around and buying new clothes just to wear them once while I watched onscreen people live miserable lives working in horrific conditions working ridiculous hours every day for pennies. It's appalling, that these people are forced to give their lives for the frivolous, unnecessary, useless, disgustingly consumerist lifestyles of people that have no clue the thousands of dead bodies they stand upon as they laugh and joke at a camera in their bedroom, surrounded by piles upon piles of overpriced, once-worn clothing. What's worse is that these needlessly consumerist people, famous for their overconsumption as if spending ridiculous sums of money just to lay waste to the planet is somehow honorable, are the corporations' role model consumer. Corporations LOVE people that spend recklessly and needlessly, that wear clothes once and then throw them away. They cater to these consumers and actively try to create them out of normal citizens, all the while exploiting people from less well-off countries to fund these lifestyles they support and create. The whole system is appalling.

"The True Cost" was an unbelievably heartbreaking movie to watch but ultimately one that has changed my life for the better. Everyone I know including myself is aware that a majority of the clothes we wear are produced in sweatshops with hardly any sort of regulations regarding safety and fair wages, but I think the reason why there is so little outrage about how we continue to rely on this practice is that they are so far removed from our reality. We think of sweatshops as an abstract collective entity rather than actual living breathing people who have touched the very clothes that we wear, countless hours of hard work and pain put into something that usually remains tucked inside of our closet for the most part never to see the light of day. It was truly heartwrenching to see a 23 year old girl only four years older than me who was living such an arduous life in Bangladesh, toiling away in a dangerous factory that had little regard for her safety and only saw her as the means of producing a profit whilst being away from her young daughter and elderly parents. The way she clung to her mother with so much love just hurt to see because she stated that she only saw her parents about once a year due to the long hours she worked daily, something that I could not imagine since I see my parents frequently. It also was outrageous to me that her factory authorities literally beat her and other women working there when they demanded a living wage, something that should be a fair-earned right as a worker but was brutally snatched from her and the others. Just seeing a personal story and the tears that she shed over other workers leading such dangerous lives at work without adequate payment truly moved me, and as a result I resolve to not buy from department stores anymore. I cannot knowingly buy from people who support such atrocities against human nature with only their own bank accounts in mind. Honestly, I've recently been really into thrifting these past months as an alternative to department store/online shopping to save money but this movie has really sealed the deal for me and I refuse to support such an awful system any longer.

The True Cost was a very eye-opening documentary. This documentary was effectively able to inform the viewer of the effects fast fashion has on the world. This was done by providing visuals of horrific events caused by the careless companies having people work in terrible conditions. At first I thought we would just learn about all the waste we make due to our over consumption in clothing, but we also saw the working conditions of those who make our clothing. I knew that they were bad, but never to this extent. Companies seem to not care at all about their workers. They put their profits before the safety of their workers. They are abusing those in need and then they try and defend themselves by saying that they are creating jobs and they wouldn’t be employed if it wasn’t for them. It makes me angry to see that big companies trying to increase their profits are the causes of major tragedies and they always go back and try to play the victim.  We saw this in Fire in Paradise where PG&E was the cause of the fire due to their equipment not being up to date just to save some money. It is frustrating to see that after all this, these companies still get away with it.

After watching the film, “The True Cost”, the film is an enlightening excursion around the globe to see quick mold, and it's horrendous human expense.I am shocked to find out that the fashion industry is the second largest chemical producer in the world. Humanity is being driven by the idea of fast fashion, which people are leaning towards at a cheap price. As a result, fashion firms keep costs so low, with many of the consumers turning a blind eye to how they turned out to have gotten that cost. In addition, the film also showcases cosmetic industries in which it is a continuous business cycle in producing new cosmetic stuff for people to buy, a great reflection of our society and our consumerism today in which our satisfaction will never be satisfied, yet we continue to develop and create things that either harm the environment or abusive labor environment, all for the sake of profit. As a component of carrying on with a reason driven life, raising cognizance and mindfulness is critical. This narrative did only that, and is awful. I'm despite everything folding my head over how to incorporate this information into my life. Expending less and smarter are the subsequent stages, yet I know there is more to be done.

After watching “The True Cost” I didn’t necessarily feel like I learned a lot I didn’t already know, however, I have definitely been enlightened. I have been aware of the horrible sweatshop conditions these people are forced to work in for less than a liveable wage, but I guess I had just put it out of my mind. Fast fashion being sold at places like Forever21 is such an easy option for picking up quick and cheap wardrobe changes, but if I thought about where these products came from everytime before choosing to go there, I probably would stop going all together. The issue with our society is that people try to and are okay with putting uncomfortable thoughts out of mind in order to steer clear of change. Similar to the harmful fast fashion industry, the meat industry is another thought most people choose not to dwell on. In the grocery store, if I thought about the animal that the meat came from and how it must have suffered in terrible conditions only to be slaughtered, I wouldn’t be able to buy/eat it. However, like most people, I put it out of mind and avoid making the change to a plant based diet because that isn’t something I would prefer. Fashion and consumption of most all goods is becoming increasingly harmful to the health of our planet and the people/things living on it, but most all seem to turn a blind eye when  making decisions. After learning more and more about the harm of fast fashion and the waste it creates, I have become much more inclined to recycle my clothes and purchase previously owned clothing. This change won’t even negatively affect my life, so I think it’s a very easy decision, and should be for most people as well.

One of the most eye-opening messages that I got from “The Ugly Cost of Fast Fashion” is that first world countries are not just exacerbating the severity of the climate crisis, but they are pushing all the negative effects to third world countries that do not contribute to climate change. The video mentions that nowadays, a lot of the factories are built in developing countries, and children are becoming sick living near the factories. America also sends trash to Kenya and other parts of Africa to be dumped there. This made me mad – how unfair is that? Creating all the trash, and then shipping it off to somewhere else? 
            <br><br>
Fast fashion definitely got more popular in the recent years because of beauty and fashion Youtubers. Every day on my recommended page, I would see Youtubers posting videos named “Crazy $1000 Shopping Spree” or “I Spent Too Much Money at the Mall!” or “Huge Collective Haul”. Keep in mind that the viewers range from early teenagers to young adults. This is how the internet is educating the youth about fast fashion right now. Not only that, companies are sending boxes and boxes of free products and clothes to Youtubers and providing their viewers with discount codes, making them want to purchase these products. A lot of small/medium clothing companies online are offering express shipping overseas (mostly located in Australia or the UK) if customers purchased over $75-100. Imagine all the pollution generated through air travel, and also through the clothes manufactured.

This film really opened my eyes to how sadly corrupt the fashion industry really is. I made the depressing connection that every time I have purchased an item from a fast fashion brand, like H&M or Forever 21, which is a lot, and gotten excited to pay a low or discounted price for an item that I really loved that the company most likely utilized the cheap labor and suffering of workers in third world developing countries to produce an article of clothing that benefits me but that I do not need. It is hard for me to believe that these workers that made the clothing in America’s most popular stores, that we wear solely for fashion purposes, were sewn together by a person in dangerous working conditions and risked their lives to make it. They work long hours to receive a few dollars a day while the selfish businessmen of America are profiting in the thousands of percentages than what they paid to have it made. These workers are dying for lazy businessmen to make two thousand percent minimum off of their hard labor. And to think of how many people have no idea the tragedies, sweat and tears with hardly a living wage in return that go into making their clothing saddens me even more. Now that I am more informed on the topic of the corruption of fast fashion I feel obligated to spread this knowledge so that we as a country can discourage this terribly selfish behavior of money hungry greedy businessmen of America. We need to put more emphasis on the encouragement of reducing consumerism and increasing reusing by buying secondhand items that are in perfectly good condition. We need to be less worried about what others think of us based on how “fresh our new fit is,” and stop and think for a second about how this purchase might be affecting others and how necessary it truly is.

The film “the true cost” is one of the most enlightening documentaries that I have ever seen. It outlined a problem that I barely understood the scale of before watching the movie. Through this film, it became  apparent to me that the united states and other developing countries have taken advantage of third world countries by outsourcing many manufacturing jobs in countries that lack adequate labor laws. This seems to me to be a direct consequence of competition seeking to sell goods at a lower price. Because of this, it needs to be on the consumer to research where and how their clothes were made to make sustainable and moral clothing choices.
             <br><br>
However, because many consumers do not have the time or education to make these important decisions, perhaps and addition regulation that ensures clothing being brought into the US was not made by people who are being treated as slaves should be put in place.

In the film, “The True COst” the viewer is exposed to the harsh reality that is the fashion industry. We are taken to several areas in different companies where we are shown the conditions that a majority of workers are forced to work in. In some places, the conditions were so bad that a building actually collapsed while people were working. THis to me is absolutely outrageous. Not only that, but we are also shown where the clothes that is thrown away end up. Astonishingly, it is just dumped on the shores of other countries for the town’s people to rummage through it. I’m not going to lie, I felt really guilty by watching that video. While I have started to shop more and more at thrift stores for those occasions when I need  clothes, I also recognized that I have been part of the problem. As a consumer, I do need to take responsibility for shopping at stores Like H and M and Forever 21. These are places that I sometimes find myself shopping for the latest styles. In the documentary it was stated that there are 52 seasons per year. And while everyone is so focused on trying to catch up on the newest styles and fashion they end up adding to the already insane amount of clothes that are created in awful setting, are worn once and eventually tossed out to make room for the newest style.

"The True Cost" was a really concerning documentary that shows the extent of which these corporations have a negative effect on countries over seas. I did know that there was a big problem with corporations destroying water sources and consuming an excess of water in India, where my parents immigrated from. However it was still disconcerting to see the amount of damage done to the people in these villages in India and other countries. In order to combat this humanitarian crisis we need to create change from the ground up. We need to help people realize the way their fashion choices and habits are greatly harming the lives of people in other countries. We also need our politicians too enact legislation that forces these corporations to practice humane business practices. To do this we as the American people need to vote with both our wallet and in the ballot box. We also need to take out ads in TV and other popular mediums to rival these clothing ads and show the other side of the fun and glamour. We need to make it unacceptable to continue to support these corporations with our wallet.

I was pretty disgusted at the large corporations who were pointed out to in the film "True Cost." People are literally dying in factory accidents, polluted water and chemical exposure for what, so we can save a quick buck on a pair of Nike's or a cheap T Shirt? The argument " oh but its ok because we are giving them jobs that help stimulate their economy and they'd be better off with this job than others" is not a valid one. This is pointed out in the film but i feel that this isn't highlighted enough. How is the life of a human being justified to be put into poor conditions because "it kind of helps." I feel that not enough people know how "true" the cost of their  clothes being processed, manufactured, and shipped really is. Imagine seeing the price of a T-shirt as "10 USD, 1 young girl's health." I can't help but get emotional on this type of things because this becomes more than an economical issue, more than a cultural, issue, more than an environmental because it also becomes an Ethics issue.

I watched “The Ugly Cost of Fashion” and was extremely saddened by the factual confirmation of what I already knew from experience. I used to shop with my mom at H&M and Zara 10 years ago, and we were getting good price for quality; my mom used to love all the colors that H&M had, and I remember buying this really pretty blue jacket that lasted me 2 years until I outgrew them. I had a Zara faux leather jacket that lasted me 3 years, which today is completely absurd to think of. It’s absolutely tragic how these companies have betrayed the consumers that were faithful to their brands. These are companies my family trusted, and today we don’t even step inside them because we know we’re being tricked with cheap quality and prices that simply don’t match the durability of that product.
             <br><br>
Greenwashing is also something that I find to be completely despicable. I understand that in the USA people can get away with saying a lot of things because freedom of speech is taken to a whole different level here, but manipulating consumers with half-truths and vague terms is an absolutely disgusting behavior. If the law won’t regulate them, then consumers should through boycotting, etc.

The film “The True Cost” brought to light many of the deeply rooted problems in the fast fashion industry. It made me realize the immense struggles and suffering clothing workers have to endure just so that we have clothing at the tip of our finger for such a cheap price. One fact in the film that shocked me was that in the 1960s 95% of our clothing was made in the U.S. and today only 3% of clothing is made in the U.S. This is important because it shows how much consumerism has taken over our society and how it has created major problems in other countries. People find quick satisfaction through retail therapy, without having a second thought about where they are buying their clothes from. This is a problem in that, people are giving their money to these big corporations who do not care about where or who is making their clothes. The major corporations only care about finding the cheapest country that will create their clothes.
             <br><br>

The film reminded me of a philosophy in yoga and meditation about how you should think about the process of everything you eat, buy, or are given.  After truly thinking about the process it took to get one of my clothing items from Forever 21, it enabled me to make a decision that I will not give any more of my money to a company that could care less about who makes their clothes and who contributes greatly to the climate crisis. Although, I do not think it is possible for me to completely avoid buying clothes because of my love for fashion, this film has encouraged me to not shop at these fast fashion chains and instead shop at thrift shops.

Every summer, I spend my holiday with my godparents in a village near Montreal. One particular thing I noticed during my stays is that they hardly ever buy new stuff. Sure we get groceries twice a week,  but almost every item in the house is older than I am. Even the washing machine was made in the 1970s. Amazed by its durability, I once operated it myself. It works as fine as the washing machine my family in Shanghai bought last year. “Things were made to last as long as they could at the beginning,” my godfather told me, “ but 30 years ago the manufacturers suddenly realized that they can’t profit if there’s no need of consumption. So nowadays those machines u see in the market can only function at its maximum capacity for 7 years. 7 year later, it goes downhill and you are forced to buy new ones.”
             <br><br>

I was astonished by the greediness those companies revealed. However I feel like this also the case in multiple industries like fashion industry and agricultural industry as well after watching “The True Cost.” Ironically, consensus seemed hard to achieve when it comes to putting into action the “voluntary code of conduct” and treat their workers in the sweatshops with human rights in those industries, but was easily gained when it comes to altering the durability of their products in order to maximize their profit.
             <br><br>

It’s truly heartbreaking to see how we end up like this. If it is the capitalism’s law of nature, that an agreement can easily be reached if it generates more profit than the common practice, and an act is hard to generalize because it harms certain parties’ way of revenue even though it focuses on improving human rights, why are we advocating such superstructure?
             <br><br>

I partially agree with Thoreal in that the industries and the economy is shaping our way of consumption, and that they profit from our desire to gain short-term satisfaction. However, it is fundamentally we ourselves who decided to indulge ourselves in the joy of owning, buying and pleasing our biological desires.

I really enjoyed reading your comment. It made me think of my grandmother's house and how similar it is to your godparent's in terms of its durability. It made me realize how I am not too from living from a much lower carbon emission lifestyle than I thought. In terms of the fashion industry, I think trends are largely dictated by the ones buying the clothing instead of influences from the designers' daily life. And if that is the case, then I think we can make durable clothing trendy. Appliances and technology, however, is mostly up to the big companies. No matter how good the condition you are able to keep it in, they will inevitably go obsolete. After watching the film I am much more conscious of who I shop from because I agree with your last sentence how in the end it is up to us on what we decide to buy.

A few months ago I went to take out the trash and I saw someone leaving Forever 21 bags next to the dumpster in a pile of trash. Shortly after, they left in their car and I went to scope the situation out. I started to open the bags and I found at least +$200 worth of clothes with brands like Hollister, Forever 21, Victoria’s Secret, and Nike. All of the clothes were in perfect condition, and coincidentally mostly in my size. So I washed the clothes and now I wear them all the time. And I put the clothes that didn’t fit me in the free bins next to the Co-op in IV so that other people could get use out of them. This showed me how careless people are with the things they once “needed” to have. 
             <br><br>

This memory popped into my head while watching “The True Cost”. This film does a fantastic job at explaining how problematic the fashion industry is and what we can do to fix it. I was shocked after hearing that the fashion industry is the 2nd biggest polluter!! Like WHAT! I knew that our fashion consumption was bad, but I never would have imagined this. It’s made me realize that I never want to buy another piece of clothing directly from a company literally ever again. I was in tears when the clothing factory in Bangladesh collapsed, killing around 1,000 people because the people in charge ignored the evacuation warnings and the workers when they told them about the cracks in the building. These companies are so devoted to profit that they couldn’t care less about the workers who are making them all of the money! I cannot stand the people who think that the fashion industry isn’t harmful. How can you learn about all of the exploitations and deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and still think that this is okay? 
             <br><br>

Another moment that was horrific was the story about how workers were asking for $160 US per month for their labor. That’s a little over $3 a day for hours of labor, that’s barely anything. And when the management heard their demands they took 30-40 of them into a room and beat them with chairs and scissors and punched and kicked them in their chest and abdomen. I had to stop the film and just sit to cool down. And we are letting this go and ignoring that these things happen as soon as that next article of clothing comes out. Because having more clothes than any of us need is more important than other people on our planet apparently. 
             <br><br>

Black Friday is one of the worst things ever. I enjoyed the good laugh when the  late night talk show host says “we are once again spending money we don’t have on things we don’t need to give to people we don’t like.” Like I can definitely remember times where I’ve done that. And I am making an effort to stop. We don’t need to consume so much! We are running the fashion industry with what we consume. Without us they don’t have jobs. So stop giving in! Stop thinking you need that shirt because it’s on sale or would be perfect for that one event, and then you never wear it again. Instead shop second hand! Shop from thrift stores, or selling apps like Mercari and Poshmark. What I like to do is get together with a bunch of my friends and have us all bring some of our clothes that we don’t want anymore because they don’t fit or we don’t like them. Then we all just switch clothes with each other. It’s completely free and we all get new clothes! There are so many easy solutions that will make a huge impact if we all agree to do our part. So let’s do our part to help ourselves and everyone on the planet. Think globally act locally!

“The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” was a great look into the industry, and definitely left me considering where all my clothing came from and how it was produced. It still astonishes me that people manage to throw out an average of 64 pieces of clothing a year. People don’t want to design their wardrobes over what is going to last and be timeless, they do it over when the next clothing shipment is going to come in. Now I know not everyone operates that way, but lots of people do, otherwise clothing stores would not feel the need to push make up 52 seasons of clothing every year, when we realistically should have 4. And most of the clothing we get rid of, even if it is donated, just ends up burned in a country like Africa, that burns 87% of the clothing they receive. But that 15% discount at H&M really seems worth the pollution that will inevitably come once they “donate” their clothes. I loved that Hasan created his own pop-up fashion store where he labeled the clothing by how much waste they produce, and how he demonstrated the ratio of wool to polyester in the orange dress he had on display. While his method of communicating with his audience may have been filled with jokes and maybe didn’t really hit people emotionally, he nevertheless effectively communicated the impacts our clothing has on the environment and other countries. I would have liked to have seen more of the human impact -- poor working conditions, sweatshops, etc. -- to really drive the point home that these fast fashion companies are deplorable, and the more we continue to buy from them, the more they will destroy and wreak havoc on our environment.

What is the true cost of our economy?
             <br><br>
The GDP goes up and is that it?
             <br><br>
People like purchasing, this is our human nature. Especially for women, most of time we just can not help buying things. But have you ever asked yourself, do you really need them? I bought many many clothes, but the truth is that I just wear some of them, and the rest are lying in my wardrobe since the day that I bought them. I am wasting my money and the resources, and the most awful thing is that I am killing people.
             <br><br>
People in developing countries make cloths for people in developed countries, and they suffer a lot. Thousands of people die from the chemical poison, the collapse of the factories, and they commit suicides. When it comes to the question “Do you feel ashamed when you wear these cloths while the people are suffering?”, an American woman answered, “No, because they are doing their jobs.” I am not surprised of this answer, but the thing is that everyone should take responsibility for this issue, not only the company owners, but also us, consumers. No trading, no harm.
             <br><br>
In life, people have problems, and the way to solve problems is consumption. We feel that the more we process the richer we are, but it is not true. Even if we own everything, if we are empty inside, we will still feel lonely and vacuous.
             <br><br>
We should buy what we do need and give other people a chance to have a life.
             <br><br>
As consumers, we should resist those products which are made by people’s blood

In my opinion, I think this movie is effective at communicating its subject. Its description of the story behind the industry of fast fashion reveal the dark side of clothing industry. The comparison of the dark side of the process of making clothes and the bright side of the final appearance of clothes makes the audience feel astonishing and impressed. Also, the movie lists specific problems of this industry by showing the interview of the people who produce clothes.
             <br><br>
I think the film’s audience will be casual audience. The movie is appealing people to pay more attention to the problems of fast fashion industry. So the director of this movie might want the public to watch this movie and can be influenced by this movie. For those who have already concerned about this problem, they might be a small part of the population and the influence of this movie might be trivial, because they have already noticed the problems behind the fast fashion industry.
             <br><br>
For me, I do not feel very emotional about this film. I temporarily feel sympathetic when I see the people who have skin cancer, but when I think about how fast fashion benefit costumers. As a costumer, fast fashion brand does bring us so much benefit when we want to buy pretty clothes with a comparatively cheap price. Also, every industry has its dark side. So although I feel sympathetic and worried about the problems cause by this industry, I still accept the existence and development of this industry.
             <br><br>
I never think about there are so many problems behind this industry when I am buying the clothes of fast fashion brands. This movie does not change my attitude much, but it does have influence on my mind. I feel optimistic about this industry. Because the growth of the fast fashion is rapid so that there come out many problems and they do not have time to solve it yet. But with the concerns of public, I think they will improve and make this industry better in the future.

The film “True Cost” effectively communicates the horrific working conditions for clothing factory workers (which are mostly women) in several different countries. This puts the awful facts of consumerism in perspective. This film is horrifying. The fact that these people are treated inhumanely in order to produce for consumers is a terrifying thought. The factories and their workers wages do not come from the big corporations that they supply and work so hard for. Most of these workers' wages are around ten dollars a month. A disgusting and appalling amount for the amount of work these people have to do. On top of that their working conditions are severely inhumane. These people are treated like they are worthless and less than others. These are human beings producing for our happiness and love for stuff. How is this still happening?
             <br><br>

This film is a perfect example of what our actions and love or “stuff” has done. As consumers we buy and buy with no concept of how it was made or who is making it. The way we contribute to fast fashion and the mistreatment of these people is an awful pill to swallow. Seeing this film is a huge wake up call. I knew the conditions in sweatshops were appalling but to actually see what it looks like is the wake up call I needed. I would recommend this film to everyone I could in order to stop promoting fast fashion.

"Disgusting" and "horrifying" were the exact same words that popped into my mind as I was watching and after I watched this film. It is appalling that some people can defend and justify the sweatshops by saying that these workers have no better alternatives, implying that they should be grateful that they aren't working elsewhere whilst completely brushing aside the fact that the working conditions are straight up inhumane. I know people who shop at cheap, fast-fashion clothing stores and buy a ton of stuff just to leave it in their closet at home and forget it about it. Before this film, I had only thought "what a waste of money" but I never stopped to think about the people who had to make the clothes and the situations they are forced into because Americans constantly, mindlessly consume. I would also recommend this film to everyone, and believe everyone should know what is happening behind the scenes when they go shopping.

After watching “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” from Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj, I realized that my own shopping habits are negatively impacting the environment. I tend to want to buy new clothes that are in trend instead of using the clothes that I already have. I do admit that I buy more clothes then I should, and this film made me more conscious of the decisions I make while shopping. I think that it is better to invest in clothing pieces that will last a very long time instead of buying fast fashion clothing that will not last a very long time and has a negative impact on the environment. Before watching this episode, I thought that donating clothes was the best way to get rid of clothing, but it was shocking to find out how much donated clothes are actually thrown away. It is also very misleading how companies like H&M and Zara are pretending to be eco-friendly and green even though they are doing the bare minimum to actually help the climate crisis. They make people believe that they are helping the environment by buying their clothes; however, the best way to help the climate crisis would be to reduce the amount of shopping in general. It is not about finding ways to make clothes that are better for the environment, it is about reducing consumerism overall.

Wow. Watching this brought tears to my eyes on numerous occasions. All this pain and suffering over… clothes. The U.S. now only makes 3% of its clothes, compared to 95% in 1960 due to fast fashion, which clearly shows how developed countries are benefitting while third world countries are paying the price. Not only are these countries, like India, losing the economic profits and struggling to put food on the table and being forced to work over the ability to go to school, they are losing their lives slaving for companies that don’t think twice about basic human rights. 
             <br><br>
Watching Ken’s video frankly pissed me off. Little girls as those most susceptible to consumerism was his example after watching this film. Really? That would’ve been the time to talk about climate justice and acknowledge what is happening in other countries. Yeah that sucks that kids in the U.S. are being targeted, but at least they are working in sweatshops. To continue why this lecture video was frustrating:
             <br><br>
1. Little boys can just as easily be brainwashed by commercials
             <br><br>
2. People of any age get wrapped into the idea of thinking they need to buy happiness-- just talk to my grandmother after her order from QVC.
             <br><br>
3. We should be discussing how to restructure consumerism and not blame individuals who are told to want more, but blame those doing the telling. Maybe talk about how America needs to start making clothes in the U.S. again, rather than outsourcing to cheaper companies that don’t care about the safety of their workers.

I also found it hard to grasp that so many individuals suffer in third world countries just for clothes that we buy and throw away soon after because we get bored with the style. It blows my mind that these multimillion corporations are getting away with this abuse of power, and aren’t punished for stripping people of their basic human rights. I personally have always gotten an uneasy feeling every time I saw “made in Bangladesh” on the tags of clothes that I bought, but I’ve always only thought about it, and never actually seen first hand how bad it actually was. Hearing the story of that woman with a daughter was so heartbreaking. It was particularly frustrating to see those clips of various people from news outlets saying that at least they are gaining jobs for this. How can that be the standard we set for those less fortunate than the developed world. And for them to act like they have a choice to work these jobs or not. Also, the scene where she explains that she tried to start a union and instead got locked in and beat. I’d like to see how these white, first world Americans deal with not even being able to start a union and being physically assaulted for even trying and still “be grateful they are at least getting jobs” at the same time. It’s just so ignorant and such a cruel way of thinking, it makes it almost unbearable to watch. I think you raise a good point about the example Ken used. Although I understand the point he is making, and see how it applies to this class, it seemed a little inappropriate to include it in a video that discussed such intense issues. I also think that you raise a good point about moving from placing blame to actually finding solutions. America definitely needs to start making their own clothes again, but I just hope that those that will be put out of jobs with this solution are able to recover. It makes me mad knowing how much they rely on these American corporations who don’t think twice about them, they deserve so much more.

<br><hr>

I appreciate your insight and do agree that media portraying sweatshops as in anyway beneficial is cruel and disgusting. Seeing clothing tags like “made in Bangladesh” or “made in China” also gives me an uneasy feeling, but hasn’t stopped me from purchasing-- a habit I hope will change in myself, as well as other students after watching this film. I’m glad you took time to talk about the injustices shown in this movie, unlike Ken’s video.

I had already seen the documentary The True Cost, so instead I watched the Patriot Act episode, “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion”. I have always been a big fan of Patriot Act and the way Hasan Minhaj is able to dive into relevant political and social topics in a concise and humorous way. In this particular video, Minhaj tackled the fast fashion industry and the many ways that it has changed the fashion industry and the health of the planet. 

             <br><br>

The fast fashion industry has completely altered the way in which clothing is produced and the rate at which people buy new clothing. In the 1980s, it was common for an individual to buy six new items a year. Today, the average new items bought in a year is 68. Minhaj explained the main reason behind this sharp increase is due to fast fashion brands such as H&M and Zara. Clothing brands such as these operate by instead putting out new clothing every season, they put out new designs every week. While high fashion brands would take upwards of 21 months to go through the process of designing, sourcing, manufacturing, and distributing, Zara has streamlined the process by knocking off designs and only manufacturing more if they are selling. Now the process takes less than 4 months. Now, high fashion brands are unable to keep up and are also trying to speed up the process. Too many clothes are being made than can be bought and worn, but the companies just keep producing, trying to make more of a profit. Sadly, this quick production of clothing is taking a huge toll on the environment. In terms of emissions, In 2015, textile production contributed more greenhouse gases than the emissions of all international flights and maritime shipping combined. It also creates immense waste. The average American throws away 80 lbs of clothing a year. And even if you decide to donate your clothing, most of the donations go to waste as well.  Just one Salvation army in New York produces 18 tons of unwanted clothing every three days. 

             <br><br>

We need to rethink the fashion industry. People need to realize the importance of quality over quantity. Why buy fast fashion brand clothing that will barely last a full year without falling apart when you can invest in quality clothing that will last you years. Additionally, more people need to look to second-hand clothing or thrifting. I am optimistic that thrifting has seen a rise in popularity recently, a trend that I hope will continue on. Turning away from fast fashion will do so much for our world in terms of environmentally and socially.

"The Ugly Cost of Fashion” was a great film. After watching that, I feel people nowadays buy too much clothes. We enjoy the happiness of buying clothes. Whether the clothes is expensive and cheap. We just buy it. Actually most of them is not necessary for us. The more we produce, the more people want to buy. So I think what we should do is to reduce the production so that we can reduce the buyers.

I agree with your comment, and am guilty of doing most of this as well. For instance, in my case I have tons of jerseys and hoodies many of which I use once or twice and never again use them. In fact most of them are just sitting there in my closet, as if I was collecting trading cards. Like you said its concerning at the rate we buy, especially when most of the stuff we buy aren’t necessary. Its concerning how much this has also happened in a matter of 40 years; from buying an average of 12 pieces of clothing to 68. This is all because its the “cool” thing to do in today’s age. Everyone needs those new pairs of jeans, or that new jacket, etc. It’s the same thing as with phones; we buy them most of the team, not because we need them, but because we want them. It’s obvious many of these companies won’t stop producing if it’s making them money. However, I think more people need to see the effects of producing all this clothing has on the planet. It is easier for the public to stop buying if all these products are made less appealing.

"The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" is a very interesting video about the fashion industry. However, hiding under the hilarious tales and comments is the inside story of the industry. There are two strategies in general to persuade people to consume: first, fashion brands release new products quickly, which is called dynamic assortment; second, they imitate the styles of luxury and sell at a much lower price. This is called knockoff, and it is even legal. Many people can't help tempting to buy clothes. As a result, fashion industries earn large amount of money just as they desired. But the price of producing countless clothes comes to many developing countries. In Indonesia, small kids get sick because of the pollution in river. Where does the pollution come from? The answer is the factories for fashion industry. Just as "climate injustice", people in devloping countries also experience "pollution injustice". Developed countries build factories in poor areas, leave all the pollutants, and bring most benefits away. What is really sad is the governor in Indonesia does not care about the problem at all. He even imagines that his people will gain mutants and become Xmen. But this is not true. Humans will die under serious pollution.

After watching The True Cost, I had no idea about fast fashion. When I first heard about fast fashion I just thought that each week there was a new style that society must follow but that is not it. The film informed that these fast fashion brands like H&M and Zara use cheap material so that you are forced to buy more clothes because the quality is not as great. I always pondered why good looking shirts were relatively cheap. Now I know that it is because after a few uses of the shirt, the quality dies down. I have a couple of shirts from H&M and Pacsun and I realize how poor the quality is. One of my favorite shirts looks like it has lint on it but it does not. The quality of the shirt is just really poor. Also I always knew about these sweatshops and how bad it must be to work there, but I did not know that this type of job is what people desire to have since it is the only job there. It is frustrating to know that these corporations do not do anything to help. If anything they work their way around the system to maximize their profits.  We need to change our system so we can help them out.

After viewing "The Ugly Cost of Fashion", I have an even more tainted view of the path of society into such a consumer and media invested place. As time goes on and the world deteriorates more and more, the fashion world continues to grow. The worst part about it is that people simply do not care. Being entertained by fashion in the media and replicating it in our own lives is just too good for people to take a step back and understand its true effects. The power of media to portray this industry in such a positive light without any concern for what its doing to the world has the population very misguided and uninformed.  The exploitation from large companies in addition to the harm they put on the world puts us in a double disadvantage.
             <br><br>

 I'll be honest and say that throughout my life, while not knowing these terrible effects, that yes I definitely think that I have benefited from the fast fashion industry because of the accessibility and false positive attitudes portrayed by the companies. Now that I know the truth however, I realize that I have done everything but benefit from this as my planet is taking the heat for what I thought I was gaining from. 
             <br><br>

This generation has grown into this attitude because we are constantly surrounded by positive influence towards it. It Is hard to have an opposing view when everything you thought you knew and trusted has been misleading you your whole life. We must change this attitude first and foremost and make a stand against these big companies that won't do anything about it unless the world fights back. They have no reason to change because they are making millions off of their deception and don't care. It is up to us to boycott their products and show them we mean business. Our world is our first priority not materialism.. There will be no fashion without a living planet.

This film “The True Cost” displays the negative impact of the fast fashion industry through the approach of the workers who make clothes for fast fashion companies and live in poverty. Fast fashion allows companies to sell clothes at cheap prices, and consumers can easily throw these away when they are out of social values, or when they run out of aesthetic value. These companies get relatively low profit from every single piece they sell, so they have to reduce the cost of their productions, and that leads to hiring cheap labor. The film records people in Bangladesh who work for large fast fashion companies. They have no insurance or healthy working places. One female worker said in the interview that she had to leave her child at home in another city because of the poisonous chemical in the factory. Moreover, they get paid at a really low wage, and that is the only income for most of the families which work in the factory. 
             <br><br>

I was pretty upset with the fast fashion culture today, not only because of the environmental pollution they produce, but also the social dynamic brough by them that exploit the cheap labor force. There is often an imbalance between the two groups of people: people who produce the smallest portion of air pollution suffer the most from it, and the workers who produce the largest amount of clothes are paid below the minimum wage. It is inhumane to exploit them and make profit out of their hard labor. The idea of accepting fast fashion is destroying our planet as long as so many individuals who try to earn a life with their hard work. Even though the price is low, the cost behind the fast fashion industry is too high for any person to take.

I actually didn’t know that Zara was a pioneer in fast fashion. Whenever I hear the words “fast fashion” I always think of Forever 21 or H&M. Talking about H&M, I’ve actually had a recent experience with H&M “greenwashing”. I was watching a video on youtube when an ad popped up for H&M’s conscious collection and I was so stoked at first because the ad seemed so good for the environment, apparently too good to be true. The ad said stats like: “ Fashion made from recycled PET bottles- at least 50% is made from recycled plastic PET bottles or other materials that have less impact on the environment”. But, after watching the Patriot Act video, I now understand that H&M is only putting out “green” advertisements to appeal to the people who care about our environment. It’s obvious that Hasan did his research because he brought up the two ways fast fashion stores are able the make so much quick and cheap money:
             <br><br>
-Quick response manufacturing: knock off design, keep raw materials on hand, make more only if item is popular, and streamline item’s distribution 
             <br><br>
-Dynamic assortment: Sell new stuff every day
             <br><br>

Hasan said instagram has a big influence on how much we need fast fashion and this really resonated with me. I am a big fan of instagram and I definitely see how, not only do you need to have a different outfit in each picture, but you also see so many “instagram models”  wearing clothing from brands like fashion nova. These advertisements and models make you want to buy from these fast fashion brands so that, maybe one day, you can look more like the models that you see every day on your feed.
             <br><br>

I can’t believe that in 2015, textile production created more greenhouse gas emissions than international flights and maritime shipping combined. That’s completely insane. 
             <br><br>
I was also really upset by the Idoneasion textile lobbyist. How can he not care that innocent people are getting hurt? How stupid can you be to try and compare what is happening to these poor villagers to a made up movie about mutants? Wasn’t he educated about how life evolves at all? Why are people like this always in positions of power in our society?

While watching Patriot Act, I felt empowered to avoid the outlets that they mentioned like H&M and Zara, which aren’t terribly difficult for me, since I can’t remember the last time I bought anything there, but after watching the True Cost, I felt devastated by the absurd loss of life in Bangladesh. And all to feed the lust of new and cheap passing fads. It’s really unfortunate that we live in a time where reality can be so far away but be shown to us in our faces. And it’s sick that businesses are able to use misleading information about their sustainability and how environmentally friendly they are. It’s disappointing also that we have no systems in place that can reuse clothes that are being sold or given away to create new fabrics for new clothes if they must. I know that there are better ways to create fashion and it’s disappointing that so much of it is virgin material. Really sad.

The film "The True Cost" does an excellent job showing how the fashion industry is a direct cause of the climate crisis and shows the tactics used in order to have consumers consume more and more each day. One part that I thought was effective in the film was showing the viewer how badly the conditions are for the children of Bangladesh. This helps the viewers see it first hand and understand that this is real and must take action now. The documentation of the real people being affected makes this problem a reality. Also, by getting the viewpoint from the business owners and factory owners helps the viewer understand why they do this in the first place. By understanding both sides of the situation we can then try to find a solution that is reasonable for both parties. Before taking this class I had known the costs of fast fashion and was aware of fast fashion is a detriment for our environment but after watching this film I realized the extent of the problem. Many other issues pertain to this problem and it is not going to be fixed by shopping second hand because only a small percentage of clothes are even donated to thrift stores. The solution is to stop buying completely! By making people aware to consume less it can very much help because many people who do not know the use will never realize and never stop so it is our responsibility to take action and tell people.

Watching the documentary, The True Cost, filled me with rage and confusion. I wish I could look inside the minds of the owners of these huge corporations and fast fashion brands to understand why profit means so much to them that they will willingly let poor workers endure such horrific conditions, earn unlivable wages, and put human lives in danger. The collapse of an eight story building in Rana Plaza that killed over a thousand people, and shortly after, a fire that struck a different manufacturing building that killed about one hundred, brought tears to my eyes. You would think this would spark change in how these industries operate and implement better conditions to the underdeveloped countries that produce the clothes we are literally wearing. But no. Instead, their numbers were rising and they could care less about the people who literally put their blood and sweat and tears into making our consumerism culture possible. And what do they get in return? Less than $100/month, fear for their health and wellness, and constantly being overlooked by the owners and industries making the real profit. It makes me sick. 
             <br><br>


Being in this class, obviously this film was presented to show us the realities of where all of our “stuff” comes from and to show the impacts it is having on our environment. I am glad that there are people fighting the odds and showing that there are better ways to do things and that are successful. The woman who brought Fair Trade Company to existence or to the woman who produces only organic cotton as she saw first hand what the chemicals and toxins can do to the planet and human health. Or in I believe it was Bangladesh, where you could see the tanneries emptying chromium into their source of drinking water, and soil they rely on for crops. These should be more than enough reasons to put an end to the consequences of the fashion industry and the consumer culture that we do not endure. These consequences do not directly affect us in our day to day life, but those in underdeveloped nations who are experiencing mass counts of birth defects, and mental retardation among children due to the unhealthy environment that is created. Enough is enough. And it starts with us. We need to be more conscious and aware of where all of our stuff comes from, and not just for the environment, but to save lives of people who do not get to live our beautiful, “American dream.” We have to learn to question the big industries because as stated in the film, if we do not consume, they do not have jobs, and they will be forced to change their ways to meet the demands of the consumers.

The film "The True Cost" was extremely effective at communicating the horrific reality of the fashion industry, especially of the fast fashion world, which is much more accessible to us all. The film was able to convey the dangers of the current system in place for producing products for major companies and consumers in first world countries by highlighting the working and living environments of the people, mostly women, working in third world countries. These workers face dangerous working environments and make less than a livable wage from this system. The film not only focuses on the impacts of fast fashion in third world countries, but it also ties the issues that farmers face throughout the world, including in the United States.
              <br><br>
I already knew about the health effects of pesticides that villages and farmers were facing, but I learned a bit more about the monopoly that Monsanto held on pesticides and seeds. I was also familiar with the terrible working conditions factory workers faced, but watching this film was the first time I ever heard about the Rana Plaza collapse and all the deaths that followed. Watching this film made me more pessimistic, especially after hearing economist Richard D. Wolff speak about capitalism and how we are unable to criticize this economic system that is the central problem for why companies will outsource to other countries. The cheap labor that third world countries provide combined with minimal worker protection makes the perfect recipe for profits when workers can be pushed to their breaking point to produce more product in a faster span of time for very little pay. Within the film, there were additional points of views included where they were trying to justify sweatshops as providing a much better life than people in such third world countries would have been afforded, and that makes their justifications much worse. When people are routinely dying and protesting for better pay in order for us to be able to purchase the latest trends at affordable prices, then something is definitely not right.

The film "The Ugly Truth of Fashion" was really eye-opening because it highlights how we have turned into a society that only follows trends. Companies like Zara and H&M are taking advantage and are selling clothes that are hurting the planet. They care about selling clothes quickly and keeping up with what people are following. It is surprising how fast people discard their clothes and how quickly they can buy new clothes. These companies are destroying the planet and places like Indonesia. Shockingly, companies are not held accountable for their actions when they are literally destroying communities and ecosystems. They are getting away with these actions because they are doing in third world countries where the government doesn't care about their people. However, there is something that we can all do and that is to use our clothes longer instead of just wearing them once. Also, I think if we start to care less about trends it will decrease the power of these companies have in the fashion industry and help places like Indonesia. Slow Fashion and just using clothes for longer will cut back our carbon footprint which will be beneficial for the environment.

After watching the film “The Ugly Truth Of Fast Fashion”, i decided to buy less fast fashion clothes as i learned how much resources produce a clothes are required and how badly it will affect environment from the film. 
              <br><br>
I was surprised when i got to know that growing the cotton to make a jacket will have taken 10330 liters of water which is 24 years of drinking water for one person. And even some clothes like lululemon pants are made from oil. I can’t imagine how much resources will the fast fashion industry use when they have 52 seasons a year and they try their best to keep advertising and attracting customers to buy more clothes.
              <br><br>
My reaction was same with the girl in the h&m store. I was feeling scammed when i knew that the only part that can be recycle from “recycle clothes” is the price tag. I was surprised that fast fashion company use “recycle clothes” to lie to people and try to comfort customer’s concern about negative impact on environment brought by purchasing clothes. These make people believe that they are doing environmental-friendly action by buying “sustainable clothes”. However, no one knows that it’s actually a business strategy.
              <br><br>
I am a person who love shopping and buying new clothes especially fast fashion clothes since those clothes are cheap and varied. But now i know how much harm will cause on environment by purchasing fast fashion clothes. I will buy high quality clothes which i really need instead of buying a bunch of unnecessary fast fashion clothes. And i will try to deal with the temptation of advertisement rationally and be clear about what i really need.

The film "The True Cost" directed by Andrew Morgan was one of the most engaging films I feel we've watched thus far. Much of which can be contributed to the tangible examples it presents. While films we've watched have emphasized carbon output and the emotional connection with the audience, this one in particular calls out the actions we take daily and the global effect they are having. By using everyday examples such as H+M and Zara, most are familiar with the presence these brands have in regard to sale and styles. The film itself does a good job in my opinion in characterizing American values in regard to chasing discounts and fulfilling a 'materialistic' need in having new things. While not 'materialistically' concerned about what our goods (clothes) are made out of, we are obsessed with the idea of acquiring new things. In personifying the industry through first hand accounts of workers across the world, Morgan works to put a face to industry we take for granted. I found it interesting to include companies who are in the industry who find it a priority to actually take into account what is good and possible to create with the current environment, such as People Tree. Stepping back, this film along with the practices of the industry have really helped me to reevaluate my own impact and my purchasing habits from such companies. While I don't view myself as a frequent purchaser within the past year,  I've bought between 10-15 items of new clothing for various reasons. Going forward, I feel that I'm, going to make it a point to consider even more how and where my clothes are produced, just as I would in regard to other purchases I make.

<p>

While watching the film “The true cost '' I was shocked at how destructive something that seems so innocent as fashion could cause so much damage. It was very saddening to see how the people in these third world countries are getting basically abused. 
              <br><br>


I believe the corporations are the problem. We don’t control how the companies make their clothes. If every single company was regulated to the point where they all have to obey labor laws and not abuse workers and the environment, this would not be a problem. Yes, the clothing would be alot more expensive, but people aren't just going to stop buying clothing just because its expensive. Look at brands like patagonia, their clothing is super expensive, but a huge demand because it is high quality and does not ruin the environment. 

              <br><br>

Listening to Ken’s video, I was sickened by the cosmetic advertisement. It is disgusting to see how companies are basically trying to mentally manipulate young women to buy cosmetics. This is just horrible and truly reflects our society. This type of advertisement should be illegal.



</p><hr>


<p>
This documentary, among several we have watched for this class, made me cry. How have we sunk so far as a society to allow this to happen? How, after becoming aware of the background of our clothing, can we justify purchasing a new article? Why do we still feel compelled to perpetuate these industries? How can we so easily fall for the gimmicks of these industries? Why are we all pursuing the mediocrity of the “American Dream” when its attainment leaves a trail of destruction, waste, and inhumanity in its wake?
              <br><br>

Our cognitive dissonance is sickening and has incredible retributions. How can we turn a blind eye to garment workers such as Shima, who was forced to abandon her daughter in hopes of providing her with a more stable future? How can we ignore massive tragedies such as Rana Plaza kill over a thousand people? How can we blindly consume knowing farmers in India are killing themselves, and children are devastatingly affected by the overuse of pesticides? Knowing now that all these social issues are intertwines with environmental issues, why are we doing this? And for what, a shirt? As both the documentary and the episode highlight, we aren’t thinking about the real cost of our purchases; since when did we value economic value over social and environmental?
              <br><br>

The interesting example of the advertisement for cosmetics on a young children’s show truly illuminates the lengths industries are willing to go to in order to procure the next generation of consumers. Examples like these, among others, make it easy to paint the industries as the bad guys in this story. Would we really buy the goods if the industry didn’t convince us we had to? However, the spell only lasts as long as we allow it to; after watching “The True Cost” or Hassan Minhaj’s fast fashion episode, some light is shed on the horrors that occur behind the scenes and as consumers, we now can choose to make educated decisions on how to consume in the future. I think one of the worst things we can do is become enlightened on issues such as these and do nothing, not even change our own actions. We have to take responsibility for our actions.

<p>

"The True Cost" gave me a clear insight of how severe the cost in the clothing industry. It mentioned brands like H&M, forever 21 and behind scenes of manufacturing. I was shocked to see the evolution of fashion industry and how it has become as nowadays view. I think we really should think about making less waste and trying to save more for our planet.



</p><hr>


<p>

The documentary “The True Cost” has ruined clothing for me. I do not want to wear clothing produced by the blood of people in other countries making this problem with fast fashion into something we must no longer ignore. The workers producing our clothes are forced to sacrifice their money, their lives, and their homes in order for this huge industry to profit. This is something I and hopefully others wouldn’t allow to happen before our eyes, so why do we allow it if it happens far away? It is illogical, plain stupid and inexcusable that we have allowed this to happen and we must change.

<p>
The films in this class have really opened my eyes to the issue of climate change and the effects that it has on the world around us. You could bring me article after article about climate change and every lecture that I ever listened to would be about the dangers that we are facing and the disadvantages that we are presenting the rest of the world as we are selfishly being consumers, but the films open my eyes to a new perspective. Let's be honest, most of us live in our little bubble of privilege and we are oblivious to what is actually going on around the world in the big picture. We see a cute shirt with a low price tag and we instantly think "wow what a steal" while having absolutely no regard for the people who were paid close to nothing to make this shirt. I had no idea about the working conditions and the hardships that faced these people around the world. The woman who gave up her daughter in hopes of making sure that she didn't fall into the same career path as she did was heartbreaking. In America we have laws and we have a minimum wage that protects the working class, and our companies are profiting off of the fact that these countries don't have that. Nobody should ever have to go to work with the fear of the building burning down for basically pennies a day. We as Americans and as consumers are selfish. It starts with us if we buy less and we have the mindset quality over quantity we can change the track that these big companies are on. We can stop this barbaric and unethical business by simply buying smarter. We don't have to support these businesses. We need to be supporting people around the world in their fight for fair wages and at the very least safe working conditions. 
              <br><br>
I feel a sense of guilt for participating and making this issue even worse. As a developed country we should be supporting each other to grow and support development. America is a great place to live and it has all of these laws that cover the bare minimum and we should be pushing for at least that in the rest of the world. This is one of those films that the secondary school curriculum should incorporate, if not to convert people to make a change right away, but at the least so they can learn some humanity and show some compassion for the rest of the world.

Watching this week’s film, “The True Cost”, made me think about this situation in an entirely new light. I had been so focused on thinking about how our actions were harming the climate and thus harming our planet, that I did not even contemplate how our actions were directly harming individuals. The fashion industry is particularly harmful. It is so quickly paced, constantly yearning more, better, newer, cheaper items. With this comes the need for more people working these jobs at even lower pay-rates. It broke my heart to hear that so many people (especially women and children) are literally working full-time and being payed $10 a MONTH. That is far beyond unacceptable. How can we support this industry with not even a hint of remorse? And who are we to blame but ourselves, normalizing and even promoting the constant acquisition of new clothing to match new trends (52 weeks per year, apparently). Yes, the industry molded us into the awful consumeristic society that we are today, but we are the ones who allowed it to happen and who continuously allow this to continue. This is utterly ridiculous. Yet it is just so prevalent and widely accepted every single day. We are constantly bombarded with advertising everywhere that we turn, telling us that we need to own more to be more. Telling us that our clothing is not good enough, that it is not new enough, that it is not “cool” enough. 
               <br><br>

I find it crazy that this all began in the decades following WWII, where the US economy literally trained and brainwashed the population into consuming more and spending more and even wasting more. The idea of “planned obsolescence” blew my mind when reading this week’s reading a few days ago, and I have not been able to stop thinking about it since. The fact that most companies do not only not care about making long-lasting products of quality, but that a lot of them INTENTIONALLY make products of lesser quality in order for their customers to have to dispose of them and continually purchase more. This seems like a straight-up scam in my eyes, yet companies have sneakily been doing this for DECADES. Not only do I think this is a scam, but I find it morally wrong in so many ways. I find it morally wrong because not only are they tricking us into spending more money, but in doing so, we are creating hundreds of times the amount of necessary waste. This is particularly applicable to technology and the electronics industry, where we create E-waste every time there is a newer, better version of a device we own that does not even need replacing. And of course, our discarded electronics rarely are recycled, as no one is going to want them if they have a “better option”. Furthermore, planned obsolescence supports unfair working conditions, as such high-demands for products means their needs to be a greater supply, which requires more employees who are almost always being underpaid.

It seems like a recurring theme that what we need to do is simply change the culture around this topic entirely. Just like with public transportation, living minimally, and working together as a community, we need to change the views upon the fashion industry. We need there to no longer be such a negative connotation around using the same items for many years, and it needs to instead be reinforced that buying second-hand clothing and keeping the same clothing for many years is the good thing to do. We need to promote the idea of reusing, reducing, and recycling our clothing. And not only with clothing, but with every item that we consume. We also need to stand up for people working in this industry, because they have little to no say in the matter, especially since many of their lives depend on these jobs. While I agree that any job is better than no job at all, it is still not right that people are working so tirelessly for so little in return. These are HUMAN LIVES. These are people that are just like the rest of us, and we are treating them completely unfairly. This world is far from fair in an overwhelming number of ways, but we need to push towards a better world in any way that we can.

My family and I like traveling. In the past, I just flew to many countries or cities, but I didn't even think about how much impact it would have on our planet. I was naive enough to think that air travel was like taking public transportation, and that the amount of pollution would be Shared by everyone like buses and subways. However, the fact is that our climate crisis is caused by air travel, which is very rapid and harmful.
               <br><br>
As an international student, I can only choose to travel by air when I go home in winter and summer vacation. The round-trip flight is about 24 hours, which makes me emit at least 6 tons of carbon dioxide per year. After watching this video, I really want to find a solution for student travel, because there are many international students in the United States who have similar situation to me.
               <br><br>
In the past, I seldom travelled by train. After Ken's recommendation, I thought it would be fun if I just wanted to travel around the country by train or by bike. However, I'm not sure I can just take the train between school and home, so I hope the government can build a railway in the future.

I like Hasan Minhaj, his ability to deal with important issues in a humorous way, and he doesn't feel like he's attacking people. In "the ugly truth about fast fashion," hasan spends 30 minutes dissecting the problems of fast-fashion companies like H&M and Zara, covering the facts about getting people involved. I agree with Ken, because there's no rush at all, because Hasan and the authors of the patriot act emphasized what they think is important to let the audience know, which is to essentially understand what you're buying.
               <br><br>
I think the ugly truth about fast fashion succeeds in talking about the environmental hazards of producing so much without getting people caught up in too much science. What this episode does not benefit from, however, is that we spend a lot of time looking back at personal anecdotes about how this culture of waste has had the greatest impact on the most economically disadvantaged groups: factory workers. When people think about environmental protection and sustainable development, they forget one important aspect, which is human rights. The documentary's ability to strike a chord with sentimentality and show how hard the culture was for these factory workers was as effective as the patriot act episode.
               <br><br>
We can all learn something from this documentary and this episode, which is to buy less stuff, buy from more honest companies, and make our stuff last longer. I am encouraged to know that we can take these individual steps today to address the climate crisis.

I'm glad that the film "The True Cost" was assigned for us to watch. This film does a good job at exposing the dark truth behind retailers and the effect that they have on us, the planet, and the workers they exploit. It is no secret that the consumers are in power here, that we hold the economic responsibility. However, the corporations are the evil monsters behind it. They are the ones that manipulate us into thinking that having the newest garments or the amount of clothing in our closets is what makes us top-tier. Thus, consumers fall into this game and are pressured into spending millions and billions of dollars to feed the second most polluting industry on earth. What angered me most about this film is the explanation behind the quote "The process is complex but simple". This being said, in the film we are taken on a journey to visualize the dark reality behind the fashion industry. Countries such as Bangladesh are featured, the same places that produce our clothing but are paying high prices for it: deaths, exploitation, threats. I was most shocked at the fact that in the 1960's, the US was making 95% of our clothes, however, now we only make around 3% and the rest is made by poor developing countries with threats of being left out of business if they do not agree on low production prices. These workers are not only being taken advantage of by western corporations but they are facing intolerable working conditions in their own jobs. If American and Eurpoean corporations are making unbelievable profit from this forn of production, why do they not do something to help those workers? This does not only have to be funding factories or demanding better working rights for the workers but it can also be done by changing the culture back in the west. We have to take into cosideration the true cost and change our consumption culture. As mentioned in the film, us consumers have the power. We demand and the corporations supply. We have to realize the damage that our demand have. Not only on our planet, not only on our mental health, but also on the workers and their families in these poor countries with these terrible working conditions. People are not only dying due to old infrastructure and suicide, they are also suffering from illness due to chemicals being poured into the air. Our capitalist system must be criticized in order to be debated and (hopefully) improved. We have to be willing to deal with the system itself since our consumer culture comes at a big price.

In the film The True Cost I found interesting that the united states makes only three percent of our own clothes and most of it is from developing countries. It's more economical for the united states, but that makes me wonder would it not be better to have all those jobs in making clothes here in the United States to help give jobs to many who do not have one  which would then allow those people to contribute to the economy and ultimately benefit the country. I am not saying trading with another country is bad but, just that relying on another country for so many products is not very good. For example what if a country like China one day decides to no longer trade mass production of goods with the U.S., what then about the economy here in the U.S because of a dramatic change on imports. Part of the fact that fast fashion has been made possible is because of the lower prices of clothes due to the labor that the U.S. uses because of the lower cost of labor found in developing countries. The lower costs then leads to more probability of reckless consumer spending because people  do not  mind getting rid of a clothing item that was cheap compared to if that item had cost much more people would probably rethink it before throwing it out. Besides that, I heard that the U.S. is becoming very indebted with China which is not good. I also found very concerning how much fast fashion has changed fashion to be very obsolete and as a result lead to a lot more waste besides emitting more greenhouse gases. 
               <br><br>
I think it is very unfair to the people in developing countries to have no say on their wage because of the power big business holds in being able to easily change to another  place for its clothes depending on how cheap they can get the products. I think there should be more regulation on international trading that the united states has with developing countries to reduce power inequality that leave those people without any choice but to work at such low wages that can not possibly give them a good quality life or endangers their lives. I was shocked to hear about the incident in Dhaka, Bangladesh where hundreds of people died due to the disregard of safety to produce cheap clothing.I think it is completely unacceptable that wealthy companies force desperate people to get to the point where they risk their lives to work to try to make a living, just so they get more money to their pockets. As a society with more work regulations and laws that protect workers which could still be improved  I think we should be more aware and care about where all these products we buy come from. When we see a cheap product we do not really stop to think where it came from and at what cost, not monetarily, but the ethical cost. Not only is fast fashion at the expense of  peoples’ lives, but also of our planets’ well being. I am crazy how our problems may be an upcoming test and perhaps having to work during college while in other places is literally about putting your life on the line doing cheap labor. As a society that is not has room for improvement but stable enough, we should be more aware not just the things that happen in the United States, but also other countries that may be suffering consequences  because of our society’s high consumerism and materialistic needs. This film has defiantly made me see things from a different point of view and made me aware of the major effects fast fashion has had.

In the past, everyone hated that the MLM Group's advertisements were too disgusting. They stimulated you to have a desire to make a lot of money. I think today's advertisements are even more disgusting. For example, there is no love because you did n’t buy anything, in order not to let the children lose on the starting line, what supplements do you have to eat when pregnant? This violent language will affect young people's values, not only misunderstanding the value of the product, but also misunderstanding the three views of others. The essence of business activities is to create business wealth. This wealth is toward human beings and towards civilization, not for your personal benefit.
               <br><br>
People's attention is easily affected by advertising. Businesses also control consumers through advertising. Maybe consumers see an advertisement once will not make them want to buy. But if this type of advertising has been around you a few years ago, would you try it? Maybe an adult can resist the temptation of advertising, but what about children? They have been exposed to the "brainwashing" of these advertisements since childhood. After they grow up, they may think that beautiful girls should make up, and they should spend money on fashion in order to be beautiful.

The way “The Ugly Cost of Fashion” provided information was entertaining while also still being enlightening. It was a different approach to informing audiences about how consumer culture elicits negative effects on our planet. I was well aware of the concept of fast fashion prior to taking this class, and even discontinued purchasing from H&M after I recently learned of their wrongful practices. However, I had not realized the process and effect behind how places like Fashion Nova rapidly recreate popular looks for a fraction of the price. The social factor of keeping up with trends is what fast fashion is driven by, and is dangerously addicting to the point that we will waste our money for as little as one occasion to show that we are current with fashion trends. I think that the 52 fashion seasons fact surprised many as it did for myself. I think that many would not guess near this number, and that has to do a lot with how little we realize our impulsive purchases run the fast fashion industry. Not only do we support fast fashion and their extremely wasteful production, but we also are wasting our money on having these ephemeral goods be shipped to us, pumping out CO2 emissions for what? To wear that dress for one picture and have it sit in your closet until you decide to throw it out? It is a viciously wasteful cycle, and our habits have allowed it to continue on for so long.

“The True Cost” showed its viewers the unseen issues and dangers forming the foundation of fast fashion. The pressure of attaining the business of large fast fashion companies has pushed developing countries to ignore and actively avoid safety precautions of clothing factories. Maybe these factories are better than some alternative income options, but the people deserve livable conditions. Just because the people in these countries don’t have much other option does not give the fast fashion companies the right to exploit their situation. 
               <br><br>
Watching this film has made me question my shopping choices. I enjoy buying cheap t-shirts from Uniqlo, scouring for the best deals and sales. Although I do not shop often, and generally keep my t-shirts for a long time and do not throw them away, I still feel responsible for supporting this system that oppresses those in developing countries and puts them in danger. 
               <br><br>
I will be more aware of my shopping choices in the future. I will probably end up buying from fast fashion stores due to my frugality but will hesitate in actually buying any clothes that I see and like. I have enough clothes for now and won’t be shopping for new clothes for a while. I also haven’t really thrifted too often, and will probably do so more in the future.

First of all, I was really upset by what I saw on this movie. “The True Cost” was an incredible documentary that really exposed the fashion industry and raised a big question: who is to blame for those who work for the fashion industry, we the consumers? Or those in power? What really pissed me off was the way workers were being treated by the fashion industry. They are treated as inferiors and that’s not right. The stories workers would tell the audience were just heart-breaking, and I couldn’t help myself but to cry at these stories. I knew that people around the world were working in really poor conditions, but I never thought it could be this bad. One story that struck me was that of the woman telling the audience about how they were beaten because they opposed the factory. Just to think about this happening made me feel uncomfortable and incredibly mad at such humans. People like these should not exist in the world, yet they do. They should be punished and incarcerated. The big industries not only mistreat their workers but also have the audacity to pollute the the poor parts of the world. This causes people that live in such polluted areas to become ill as well as their progeny. It was also heart-breaking to see the little kids who suffer from the byproduct of these companies. The mothers literally wait for their children to die. No mother should experience such a hardship. All these industries do not take responsibility of what they have done and probably never will. While this documentary brought the environmental issues that come with the fashion and other big companies, it also brought up the mistreatment workers experience by their superiors. These companies excuse themselves by saying that the worker has the option of working or not at such companies. And that this is way better than working on something that could be described as a crime. These companies should be regulated by governments and make the respect the worker’s rights. Just because they are poor and in need of a job, you do not get to treat them bad. They have the same rights as all of us. We should dismantle such companies because it only yields a positive impact in our lives. One of them is that there will be an incredible reduction in consumerism and pollution, but also a world where people are not treated as nothing.

The battle between consumers versus corporations and who started the “need to have it” is complicated. Yes, the corporations made it because we wanted it--but at some point corporations get us to want what they have. For popular brands like Urban, Lululemon, etc. When new styles come out we need to have them. I would argue it is a bit of both the consumer and corporations that contribute to the issue. 

               <br><br>

The problem is that the stuff they make requires emitting emissions--not great for the atmosphere. 
               <br><br>


To counteract fast fashion there are lots of alternatives such as using what you have, thrifting, or borrowing from a friend. I am a big fan of the Isla Vista trading post here at UCSB because they do all the hard work for you--they literally will come to your house to pick up your donations and then set up events where you can go and get free or nearly free pre-owned clothes. 
               <br><br>


Other ways of counteracting fast fashion and other environmental threats have been through comedy on popular netflix shows like Patriot Act. I agree that this form of education to the public is very effective because it intertwines facts and truths in a fun and easy delivery. Hopefully more shows come along like this that can appease not only our generations but the older ones as well--this way we could work towards getting on the same page about the climate crisis issues.

In "The Ugly True Cost of Fashion", Hasan Minhaj shows his viewers how wasteful we are when it comes to articles of clothing. Hasan uses humor to show how wasteful we are how companies like Zara and H&M have introduced knock offs of popular items of clothing. This is actually a very smart tactic on the companies part because it's not like the average person is going to afford the same exact dress Kim Kardashian is wearing. It also shows how these companies use tactics to make the consumer feel that they are being environmentally friendly, but in reality they are not. A part of the film that really aggravated me was how companies make bold claims stating how they reuse and recycle a majority of their clothing, but they disclose that this does not apply to many of the factories where their waste comes from. This is aggravating because this can be a main reason as to why their products are purchased and the consumers buys the products because it is very unlikely that they are going to ask just what exactly is going to be recycled. Another thing that aggravated me was how some stores have things where you can give them your unused clothes. This aggravated me because in return for the clothes, the store gives them a discount just to buy more clothes. Giving your clothes and buying more clothes does not benefit the earth. I know in the video, Hasan said that we should just wear our clothes longer, but I feel like this is not only what we should do. I feel that we also need to buy less clothing. Kens previous lecture shows that we purchase on average 64 new items of clothing each year. Some of these items are never worn or only worn once or twice. This is an absolute waste. I liked this film because it kept my attention and really showed me how foolish some of us can be when it comes to clothing. Most of this foolishness isn't our fault, it is the companies faults who feel it necessary to keep information from the consumer buying their problem. Everything that these companies do is based on profit and no regard to the planets well-being is put into consideration.

I once considered visiting New York and seeing time square a dream goal of mine but after learning how damaging it is to not only travel there but also the not so hidden dark secrets behind the flashy ads, I have changed my mind. I do question who is more at fault for these problems though. Is it these big companies who only have tunnel vision for the money or is it us as consumers for taking the bait they serve us as commercials? I will never look at stores like Forever 21 or H&M again without the thought of the workers who lost their lives due to negligence or the ones struggling to raise a family earning unlivable wages. What makes it even worse is fast fashion industries are also silent killer of this planet. Shopping is one of my favorite things to do. The first thing I love to do is finding the cheapest deal in a mall or at a store. I never though to think of the dark story behind my shirts when they become mine. In fact if I had never taken this class I probably would have went the rest of my life not thinking twice about the cruel background of fashion. Even now it is still gonna be hard to change some of my ways when it comes to not buying the cheapest product. The biggest influencers who have millions of followers promote the American Dream like it is attainable. This sets unrealistic standards which makes us insecure and more willing to buy whatever it takes to be slightly like someone who appears to have it all. I feel like the only way to get the point across and inform people is by making the same flashy short ads that reel people in to begin with. Another method that can used is showing more of the faces and stories of the real people who suffer the most. For example, the Rana Plaza accident was one I had never heard of until watching "The True Cost" and it left an impact that will stay with me forever. The population must be shown the price others must pay to feed their consumerism.



</p><hr>


<p>
After watching The True Cost, I could not forget all of the horrible scenes and stories that I saw during the movie, and I was shocked and stunned at my ignorance towards fast fashion and how much more ugly aspects of it that are going on every day yet I am oblivious to. The True Cost does a fantastic job of exposing the filthy, dirty, and corrupted truths behind the fashion industry and the entire toxic, exploitative, profit-centered system of the fashion and clothing industries. 

               <br><br>

One particular scene in the film that really touched me was the Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh, and I was mortified by its negative consequences and infuriated at the actions of the factory owners and the fashion brands towards this incident and other similar horrible accidents. I just couldn’t believe how the factory owners could bear to refuse the workers’ demands to attend to the cracks in the walls until the building collapsed one day and ended up killing so many innocent workers who had already given the factory owners fair warnings. Those workers didn’t have to die but yet they did, and the factory owner and the top fashion brands should be held accountable for their deaths because they didn’t die due to the collapse of the building; they died due to the endless greed and fear of the factory owners and the fashion brands for more profits, more money, and more clothing products to attract more consumers so they don’t lose money and profits for their businesses. 
               <br><br>


What angered me even more was the factory owners’ treatment towards their workers who were primarily female when the workers couldn’t take it anymore and took it to the streets to demand increased minimum wages and safer working conditions. In Bangladesh, the factory owners brutally beat their workers, attacked them with every possible tool in the room including chairs, scissors, desks, and more; in Cambodia, the government, fearing the loss of economic revenues and profits from the fashion brands’ threats to pull out orders from Cambodia and placing them elsewhere, ordered police forces to counter worker protests and cruelly suppressed the protest by arresting, killing, and injuring many workers. These incidents made me so angry because this is essentially telling me that the workers who, just like the Bangladesh worker said in the film, made clothes with their blood, have no rights or voice whatsoever in the fashion industry chain that is, just like the director of the film said, designed to perfectly trap the workers and laborers in with no way out. 

               <br><br>

Besides the humanitarian toll, fast fashion also has numerous negative environmental impacts with the immense amount of pollution and carbon dioxide that are emitted into the water sources and into the atmosphere respectively. The pollution from the manufacturing of clothes has reached such an appalling state that it is bringing birth defects, cancers, mental illnesses, handicaps, and all other kinds of health disorders and threats to the local people in the Third World countries where those clothes were made. Those people have no way to treat those diseases because they are so poor and the little wages they earned from making clothes in the factories are barely the minimum for them to sustain their basic daily needs. 
               <br><br>


All in all, fast fashion is an intricately designed economic machine to reap the maximum amount of profits from and exploit the laborers as much as possible. Just like the film stated, when profits come into play such as it is in the fashion industry, human rights, the environment, and all other humanitarian egalitarian values that we uphold so dearly are gone. This is terrible, and we need to make changes now, starting from ourselves. Stop buying clothes you don’t need and consider second-hand options such as thrift stores.

I first watched "The True Cost" a while ago, but decided to rewatch half of it and also watch "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" for this week. The True Cost really changed the way I looked at stores like Forever 21. I only ever go in there when I am dragged along by my friends and whenever I go in, I remember about all the devastating scenes shown in the film and I think about the workers themselves and it really makes me vey sad and disgusted. For one of my other classes in a previous quarter, there was an optional reading that I think was titled "The Shirt on Your Back." It showed a lot of the scenes in the film, but also gave you the amount the workers have made compared to the amount the corporation is making during the time you are reading/ on the website, and it was really provoking. 
               <br><br>
"The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" was really thought provoking. It's interesting that an item can be labeled as "eco friendly" even if that label only applies to less than 5% of the clothing piece. Something that stood out from this video to me was the part he mentioned about cheap dress shirts. This resonated with me because whenever I was in high school and had to dress up for class projects or things of the like, the store he mentioned would be my first stop. After watching the film "The True Cost" I told myself to never shop at that store again. Another interesting part of the video was the part about FashionNova. I remember seeing them put up a a famous persons' dress in a matter of hours and being shocked that they could do such a thing.



</p><hr>


<p>
When going to stores like Forever 21 or H&M, I never even knew what I was actually putting my money into. “The True Cost” absolutely broke my heart for those workers who put in all that work and effort and are practically risking their lives doing so because they’re in terrible work conditions. What makes me more upset is that those who stand up for their rights and demand better pay and conditions are beaten or even killed. Are they not human? Do they not deserve healthy conditions and good pay like any other human being? That was really all I could ask myself. The audacity of that woman saying that they could just get another job made me so disgusted. 
               <br><br>

I thought hard about my shopping habits and I would rather not support clothing stores I usually would shop at. I thrift a lot and I enjoy going to yard sales, so I think I’ll just stick with those. Speaking of thrifting. I was devastated to learn that only 10% of what we donate actually gets sold in thrift stores because I often donate to Goodwill, so it hurts to know that it’s not even guaranteed to get to other people. I want to look into giving to local homeless shelters instead or maybe giving to more direct outlets in general? I think my biggest question during the film was, like others, how can we change the way we consume? I mentioned in one of my other comments that it’s difficult to tell people to be more minimal because American culture is obsessed with the hottest trends and newest clothes. I think it’s important for people to be conscious of who they’re buying from, why they’re buying it, and alternatives. I think those 3 things could be a start, but how far it would go is beyond me.
               <br><br>

Overall, it upsets me that America is so selfish. That news reporter saying “thanks” to those poor workers for her smartphone was so insensitive and disgusting. If anything, it just proves a point.




</p><hr>


<p>
Before watching “The True Cost” I already had had a little knowledge about fast fashion in third world countries. But learning about the devastating impact it has on these third world women and the environment left me dumbfounded. Hearing the statistics of the amount of clothing waste first world countries generate left me disgusted since we were also shown polluting Haiti and filling landfills. Human rights are taken away and these workers are exploited for the price of our clothing to be lowered. I always wondered how places like Forever 21 and Aeropostale can afford to sell their clothing and ridiculously cheap prices and this documentary gave me my answer. It is sad to see how these communities are destroyed because of our selfish materialistic need for things. Specifically, third world women and the environment are exploited. 
               <br><br>

“Because the major brands do not officially employ the workers… [companies] remaining free of responsibility for the effects of poverty wages, factory disasters, and the ongoing violent treatment of workers.” 
               <br><br>
This is how this cycle continues, these companies keep their conscious clean by claiming they have nothing to do with the factories while the third world women remain enslaved. The worker told stories of the factory supervisors beating them up and harassing them; the factory owner indirectly admits it as he talked about how the female workers need to respect him and not act up. Not only are they being hurt in these ways, but Viviana Shiva describes the Green Revolution effect on the cotton that is demanded by these fashion companies. They monopolized the seeds so that the small farmers were forced to buy them; eventually, they went into debt and many killed themselves with the pesticides. The women suffer the most in this situation because they are forced to take jobs that pay next to nothing while also finding ways to care for their children. Learning about the mentally challenged children that are born in these villages due to the toxic environment left me devastated. They are paying the price for our unnecessary consumerism and selfish needs, so we need to think about what we buy. I will start going to second-hand stores more and exploring other options.

This week’s video reminded me of a blog post I read in 2012. It talked about how factory workers got the liver disease by working unprotected in a jeans factory. That factory made jeans for fast fashion brands like H&M and Zara, which are very popular among college students. I still remember how shocked and angry I was when I read that post. As a teenager growing in a big city back to that time, I was not able to imagine there were people facing toxic chemical dyes without wearing any production. After I watched this week’s film, the first thing I came up with was this blog post. Sadly, in the fashion industry, many of the workers’ safety cannot be guaranteed, just like the tragedy of the Bangladesh Rana Plaza incident introduced in the movie. These workers worked in such unsafe environments but they couldn’t even get the wage they deserved. Their low income forced them to work extra hours in order to make more money, which is very inhuman.

               <br><br>

While those workers working so hard, every American would purchase 60 pieces of cloth per year on average. Thus, here’s the question: do we really need those clothes we bought? I believe it’s common for people to find some brand new clothes with their tags on at the corner of the closet while they can’t remember when they got them. These are the waste we created. I know people may donate their old clothes, I’m not an exception. And this is why I was surprised when I learned that many of those donated clothes would become wastes and even cause pollution. From this point, I don’t even think it is worthy for those workers to work so hard under that kind of terrible environment.

"The Ugly Cost of Fashion” was a great film for this class to watch and it shocked me with the information that I have never heard before. As it stated in the film, they visit the famous brands "Zara" and "H&M". The girl knew the only part that can be recycle from clothes are their price tags. The girl was totally surprised with the result she got. The girl felt like she was scammed by the fact.
               <br><br>
What kind of recycle this is, I think this is a lie. Every year those companies produce too many clothes that they can sell, and everything they can recycle from those leftovers are their price tags. This is a total waste for our earth. Moreover, some famous brands use many animals’ fur for their products, for example, crocodiles, ostriches, elephants...some of those species are disappearing, and the way they kill those animals are so cruel. In order to get the full tooth of the elephants, people will saw it when the elephants are alive. Those animals share the same earth with us, what we can do is provide them a good environment and definitely not slaying them like this. This is the ugly cost of fashion.

Prior to watching this documentary, I was aware of the terrible effects the fast fashion industry had on the living conditions of workers in sweatshops in third world countries, especially after hearing about the garment factory collapse in Dhaka. However, I had never considered the even deeper roots of the fast fashion industry: the raw materials used for clothing themselves. With clothing companies looking to make clothing as cheap as possible, they have to make the production as cheap as possible, and, in turn, the materials must be as cheap as possible too. In order to meet the demands of the companies, cotton farmers resort to using pesticides to maximize their harvest. The fact that farmers are forced to use chemicals that will knowingly cause them harm is ridiculous, and it’s absolutely depressing that some farmers are driven to suicide when they are forced to turn over their farms since they are not receiving enough compensation for their crops.
                <br><br>
The fast fashion industry is one of the major reasons we waste so much as a society, but as this documentary shows, it is much more than an environmental problem; it is also a human rights issue. With companies realizing that they aren’t responsible for ensuring the workers’ rights, and squeezing money from the owners of the sweatshops, people’s dignity is left in the dust. This is a result of our capitalist economy and is honestly unacceptable. I’m not saying that capitalism is inherently bad, but if it is disregarding the living conditions of human beings, maybe the system needs to be rethought a bit.

I love Hasan Minhaj and his ability to tackle important issues in a comedic way that doesn’t feel like he’s attacking people. In “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion”, Hasan breaks down the issues of fast fashion companies like H&M and Zara in 30 minutes that covers facts that keep people engaged. I agree with Ken in that it doesn’t feel rushed in any way because Hasan and the writers of the Patriot Act managed to highlight what they believed was important for the audience to know, and that is to essentially understand what you’re buying. 
                <br><br>

I think “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” was successful in talking about the environmental harms of producing so much without bogging people down in too much scientifics. However, something that this episode didn’t have that “The True Cost” was able to benefit from was the amount of time to go over personal anecdotes about how this wasteful culture has the biggest impact on the most economically disadvantaged: factory workers. When people think of environmentalism and sustainability, a huge aspect they forget is the human rights aspect of it. The documentaries ability to strike people’s pathos and show how difficult this culture has on these factory workers is just as effective in convincing people as did The Patriot Act’s episode. 

                <br><br>

We can all take something from both this documentary and this episode which is to buy less, buy from more honest companies, and make our items last longer. It feels very empowering to know that we can take these individual steps today to tackle the climate crisis.

"The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" with Hasan Minhaj is a comedic approach to a serious issue, a more common tact nowadays, with Trevor Noah, John Oliver, and others bringing brevity to depressing topics. When Hasan talked about how companies take advantage of the consumer trend towards environmentally friendly everything, it started to make sense. I'll see that a label says "recycled" or "ethically sourced," and I'm immediately more inclined to pick it up. Hasan got me thinking halfway through, "what DO I wear if new clothes are made so unethically?" and low-and-behold, the solution was presented. Thrifting and wearing clothes for longer periods of time is the answer. 
                <br><br>
It was sad to see that the CEO of Zara is one of the richest men in the world, essentially off of absolute rip offs. Personally, when I go thrift shopping and find deals, I feel an (unearned) sense of accomplishment. Thrift shopping is cheaper, more unique, and the clothes have more personality. If we can shift culture away from wearing whatever the latest trend is, and towards making clothes last longer, we have a shot at making the fashion industry so much more environmentally friendly.

The “Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” with Hasan Minhaj showed the truth to fast fashion by revealing the lies large companies use to greenwash their brand. It is also baffling knowing how most of the material to make these cheap clothes are made of mostly plastic particles, despite the environmentally friendly description on their greenwashed tag. The cultural mindset of fast fashion mirrors the mindset of consumeristic America, wanting things cheap, and ignoring the true costs. The fast fashion industry is harmful to society, the environment, as well as human rights. The fast fashion industry should be recognized for these true costs so that culture can shift away from this industry.

The True Cost really shows the literal “living off of someone else’s misery”. The corporations take advantage of the people from third-world countries, advertising their products and hide the countless sufferings behind the scenes, and we the consumers continue to consume to please ourselves and stay oblivious to the real cost of what we are buying. 
                  <br><br>
  The entire consumer culture (which includes Fast Fashion) resembles a cult: the corporations are the “mighty gods”, “preaching” their gospel of consumerism, and we the consumers worship them, some people are so obsessed with shopping that it becomes an addiction that brings actual psychological effects. There are countless examples of manipulation like this in the past—pyramid scheme, cult, or other illegal organizations, and they all have destroyed countless lives. If you look back at those incidents, you might find how ridiculous those groups are, and you might not be able to understand the reason why anyone would be willing to join such groups, but ironically we have been in this “consumerism cult” for decades. 
                <br><br>
    It might seem that the corporations have manipulated us, and they are at fault, which is true, but we as consumers have become so involved in this “cult”, we need to take the responsibility as its accomplices. It is difficult to expect the corporations to take action any time soon, but we can take action to end this, as we are also part of this vicious cycle. 
                <br><br>

    “People from the third-world countries don’t have a better alternative other than working for the textile industry, they could be doing something so much worse”, “these jobs bring skills, bring economical opportunities”, and all other similar claims sound reasonable at first, but only people who have overlooked the real problem can say such a thing. No better alternatives? As stated in the movie, “nature is an economy”, and looking at Thoreau’s life in the woods, I would say living in the wild is much better than working in a flimsy building with chemicals accumulating in the air, earning close to nothing. Bringing skills and economical opportunities? First of all, these people are not even working for themselves—they are working for the people overseas, and cheap labor is the very reason why they get to do these instead of us. Moreover, the corporations use their monopoly on the factories and supplies to force these workers to compete with each other for worse and worse pay. Even worse, the waste created from these factories, the pesticides and other chemicals used have contaminated the land, severely hampering the potential development of these countries. These corporations are destroying local economies as opposed to improving the lives in the third-world countries.
                <br><br>
    The movie gets even more painful to watch when it starts talking about how the Cambodian government suppresses the garment workers’ protest for a minimum wage. It seems that even the government doesn’t have a clue about what is being done to their country by accepting deals from these corporations, because clearly this will not help their economy in the long run. Once again, the working people continue to suffer from the unfair deals from these corporations, our demand as consumers, and the ignorance of their own government.
                <br><br>

    The negative environmental impact in this whole chain of textile/agricultural production makes me agree with Richard Wolff. Should we improve the workers’ conditions? Of course, but these jobs are not even the jobs they are supposed to be doing, as these jobs only do harm to the environment with little economic benefits. Something about this system needs to change, and it is going to be difficult to change because how many aspects of our lives are involved in this issue.

Your comment resonates with my thoughts throughout the movie. It is very hard for me to care about blame or environmental impacts when I think about the physical suffering people are going through right now for our goods. As Ken points out in this intro, no one benefits off this system. We are all being affected by climate change, yes, but the suffering of disadvantaged people is by far the worst side effect of consumerism to me, even over ecology. For such a modern world, it is unnecessary for people to suffer like this, it is embarrassing, and it is heartbreaking. Your comment on how these jobs shouldn't even exist is especially poignant. If we cut our consumerism toward mega corporations and factory-made wares down and invested in people and small businesses, than these businesses would not exist. And by keeping purchases local, the emissions from shipping are cut down. The clothing industry as presented in this movie leads me to reaffirm my beliefs in shopping small and buying used. Or buying less! These people will never be able to thrive or build their own economies until Western countries stop swooping in and purposefully taking advantage. And it will not stop unless we practice ethical  consumerism in our own lives. 
                <br><br>
The movie itself I appreciated for not pulling its punches. It did not shy away from the issue at hand, and did not hesitate to cast the blame where it needed to go. Which is basically everywhere. To consumers, manufacturers, advertisers, and governments that watch these factories operate and don't (or can't) protect their people. While I greatly enjoyed The Patriot Act video, and thought it was a very effective tool to get people to learn about this issue, I personally preferred the more hard hitting, and longer documentary.


<br><hr>

I totally agree. Personally I am a big believer in our capitalist economy but it is clear that it fails to bring the best result sometimes. This makes me think again that we as a country somehow value our own luxury and wealth much, much higher than the lives of people in third-world countries. As long as our country doesn't have an issue with profiting off of poisoning Southeastern Asian children, this will continue. I would argue that as arguably the most powerful entity on Earth it is our responsibility to at least not cause huge issues in other countries that have no better options. While clearly Indian leather workers have no better form of employment, it is clear that the pollution is much more harmful that the economic benefits wrought from the tanneries, and in order for this system to work, legal action as well as action by the customer must be taken

The film was so effective at communicating its subject, since it contained a lot of interviews to introduce what’s the current situations really like and the vivid images of the workers’ terrible living conditions, which successfully appealed the audiences’ emotions to feel the same angers and sadnesses as the poor workers in the film. People’s sympathy will be evoked by these direct and engaging ways.
                <br><br>
My general reaction to this film is emotional. It frustrated me a lot when the collapse of the building in Bangladesh was introduced by the relatives of the victims. I was considering my own purchases of products in these fast fashion shops, even without acknowledging any news of the death of over one thousand people in that terrible working conditions. People including me often just care how cheap the clothes are instead of considering why are they so cheap and what tragedy is behind these fast fashion clothes. 
                <br><br>

I really learned a lot from this film. Actually, I self-examined a lot after watching the film. I often considered myself as a person with some consciousness of caring the environment. since I paid a lot of  attention on pollutions and climate changes, however, I never thought that clothes displayed such a “outstanding” role in the destruction of the environment. Nowadays, we sometimes buy clothes without considering whether we will wear it very often, which leads to a situation that we buy too many clothes and many of them are unnecessary. It is usual for us to buy new clothes, even we have’t already wore all the clothes we purchased last time. The real reason of these tragedies was the high demands of clothes, which was caused by us, even though the majority of us aren't even aware of the negative effects caused by the fashion. Actually, I feel pessimistic, since it was so hard to make effective changes in these under-recognized issues. We can’t just simply let these fast fashion industries to disappear, for many people still make a living in these industries.

To answer Ken’s question, I do agree with Thoreau. Obviously, consumers cannot ignore the part we play, but I believe manufacturers are principally to blame for this consumerist culture that has been created. Yes, demand is high, but the rate at which these products are being produced far exceeds the rate of demand. They have taught us to be wasteful and buy the newest products when our current products are more than fine to use. An example of this is the fast electronics industry that mirrors the fast fashion industry. Apple releases a new iPhone every year, pursuing us to upgrade from our perfectly capable phones. We, as consumers, then give in to buying the newest product when we know it is not a necessity.

I think the film “The True Cost” expresses its subject very effective due to the cruel facts. Hundreds of garment workers died because of manager's negligence about unsafe working environment; many garment workers must sacrifice their time with children for keeping the job; lots of garment workers can't even receive the minimum wages to support their life. All of these are part of the true cost behind the clothes that don't count by the capitalism. I feel very sad for the people in the third world country. In the film, their living condition is so poor, and many of them got serious diseases. Especially, the mother who can only wait his child's death makes me feel their sense of powerlessness about the life. Then, by comparing my life with theirs, I think that I am very lucky born in a much better environment. I feel the responsibility that at least I need to do something for them, because they don't deserve such suffering. 
                <br><br>
From this film, I learn the cruelty of the world. The big international brand companies are the people with strong power, while the countries providing outsource services are weak side. The big companies have the right to demand the price, while those countries can only accept, or they will lose the job opportunity. This just proves that lagging leaves one vulnerable to attacks. After watching this, I feel pessimistic, because the economic pattern of the powerful side is hard to change due to its tremendous impact.

After this film and attending lectures, it really opened my eyes to my consumption regarding clothes.  I need to stop buying a lot of cheap clothes that have no value to them and start buying one or two clothing pieces that have value so I cherish them more.  So what I got from this is that I need to stop buying cheap clothes and buy some Gucci clothes because I rather have 3 Gucci shirts than 100 random shirts and this would be good for the climate and clothing workers.  The conditions of the workers in third world countries were saddening to see and for a building to fall on top of them and the executive says "there are way more dangerous things they could be doing" was so ignorant.  Then she followed up with an "I don't see what's so dangerous about sewing" like really a big ass building killing your workers isn't dangerous.  The companies are really that cheap that they won't make buildings that their workers can work in without fearing if today's the day that the roof is going to crush us.  Overall, the US companies in charge of these laborers are ignorant and nothing will change because Americans feel sad for them but won't act to change the laborer conditions because that will affect the price of their product.

After watching the film The True Cost, I’m concerned about the way I shop and more importantly, the way the world shop. Our mass consumption in the developed countries negatively impacts the rest of the world. This knowledge is sad, as only the one billion people that live in developed countries are hurting the six billion people in developing countries. I found myself getting angry when people were being asked “How do you feel about people working in sweatshops in Bangladesh?” and their response was “Well someone has to do it.” No one should have to work in the poor conditions that the people in Bangladesh and China are under. The collapse of the clothing factory in Bangladesh, although awful, was good as it raised awareness around the world about an issue that was not publicized. People in the developed countries began to see the terrible working conditions coming from our growing demand in fast fashion. 
                <br><br>

I have fallen victim to shopping during Ken’s lectures, I have no problem admitting it. Clothing brands get to consumers by their sales and new items. I often find myself shopping Urban Outfitters when I’m bored because of their great sales and on trend items. I now like to think about where my clothes are being made. 
                <br><br>

The idea that shopping gives people a sort of rush seems to hold true. People feel excited and happy when they make a purchase and receive the clothes. The rush seems to continue to when they wear it the first few times. But soon after those clothes lose their value and desirability, so we go out and purchase more. This cycle is why clothing is consumed so fast and so much.

I have seen many documentaries, but when it comes to human exploitation this is by far the most question arising documentaries I have ever seen. what is development? social justice? basic humanity? When companies in order to reduce their cost prices and increase profits employ destitute people who doesn't have any alternate career other than being a laborer for a meager salary in sweatshops, and supporting their act by claiming that they are providing livelihood to these wretched lives as if they were not living before these companies came. What do you call it if not social exploitation?

The words spoken by the environmental activist are cent percent true. Fertilizers and seed business in an epidemic in India that is not there before the 1950s. They affected the generations of Punjab region both medically and economically.

Many might think this docu to be an anti-capitalistic propaganda. But developing capitalistic economies at the cost of what? companies might not feel empathy with argument, but a consumer should feel it before falling in the craze of "Brands". They have to remember those hands that suffered for producing the clothing that you're buying at "discounted" prices and festive sales.

After watching the film "The Ugly Truth of Fashion," I am mind-boggling about what are fashion companies are currently doing. If I didn't watch this movie, I may never know how clothing companies are producing recycled clothes. The most impressive part for me is when the host of a clothing store tells customer that the only recycled part of clothes was the tag. It's astonishing to me that why are the companies recycled the most unnecessary part of clothes?  Also, it's hard to imagine that nowadays there are 52 seasons per year. Is it telling us that every week we can wear a set of new clothes? Moreover, the working condition for those workers are extremely harsh. The fashion company take advantage of cheap labor to make excessive profit. They pay for workers only $3 a day, and by sadly saying that they are not being treated as human. If they get ill, they have no choice but to die, since they even don't have money to cure themselves, let alone their kids. It's extremely immoral for our modern world, and how can these companies' executives sleep tight and live happily when they using the money cost by hundreds people's blood and lives.

The fashion industry is an unstoppable force. It is really unfortunate that the fashion industry is so bad for the environment because clothing production and purchasing is something that we wont be able to really control as protesters say they use fashion as their form of expression. But one way we can be batter is by making the production of clothing a more humane process. We have to be able to compromise somewhere and the way that we have to compromise is by having to spend more money on clothing. This is the only way that we can get this ruthless industry under control. If there is no other option but. to simply pay more for the clothes then everyone will have to do it and low priced clothing will come to an end. 
                <br><br>

We can’t sit here and rely on the people who are facing the opression to take a stand. As we heard in the video, the women who tried to take a stand in bangledesh were locked in a room and beaten up severely. These women are not treated fairly and so here, where we can make more of a difference with our voice, we must demand more change. As of now, we have 52 seasons, because we can. Becuase we don’t see what is happening behind the scenes. And as Ken always says, we need to educate people before we can make a difference. Hearing of all the people suffering in the opressive and dangerous conditions of sweat shops makes me more concious of where I will be buying clothes and how much I pay for it. But it also saddens me how we have to bother to look and create brands who are concious of ethical treatment of humans and promoting livable wages. Why can’t everywhere have this same standard and respect for human lives.

It made me very angry and at the same time, very sad when I saw the woman responds and says that people are just doing their job when she is asked about American companies' exploitation of workers in developing countries. We are all born equally as humans with equal rights. Why the hell in the world do they have to suffer from working for extremely long hours in the dangerous workplace with little income, and you can sit there, safe and sound, making thousands a year, wearing luxuries, and talking like that. No one deserves that.

This documentary also makes me aware of two things. First, I will be more aware of things I buy in the future, especially the clothes and how they get produced. It is hard not to think that so many apparels are made based on employer exploitation, adding way more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere, and polluting our water and lands. The second one is harder, but I want to rethink how I process the information from the advertisement. As a communication major who wants to get into the marketing field, I was once amazed at how a company can have so many ways to sell their products through marketing, and not at all realizing the element of manipulation and increasingly unethical strategies. I also unconsciously accept to be in the money-oriented system, and that money means better. At the end of the film, this system-wide problem is pointed out, I wonder what's the solution to it.

This was not a film I was expecting to be particularly moved by, however, out of all of the films watched in this class, "The True Cost" has been the only one to shake me to my core. Ok yes, I said, fast fashion is bad but so is practically everything else so what's the point of caring if the whole world is going to shit? Then I watched this film and realized it was so much worse. How can I, sitting on my full sized bed, attending a prestigious university, and going to sleep every night with a full stomach be so hopeless for our world when there are people working in sweat shops, thousands of miles from their families, barely surviving day to day, who have endless optimism for the future. I wish it could all be blamed on toxic consumerism and capitalism and greedy companies that care more about their dollar than their worker, but it can't. It’s also the fault of each individual greedy enough to take part in this cycle and rich enough not to care about the consequences. I believe about 99% of the world is unhappy, which means 99% of the world is looking to fill a void any way they can. The U.S., European countries, and any anywhere else with pockets of wealth are taught to fill that void using materialism. And we buy into it, literally, time after time even though it has never delivered on its promise. We are so wrapped up in these false promises that we have tricked ourselves into believing we NEED those new nikes, that morphe palette, something Gucci of course, and at least one pair of lulu lemon leggings so that WE know, even if everything else in our lives is complete crap, at least we fit in and look good. That is what America's definition of happiness has become; fit in and look good. Make money ..at the cost of your personal identity, buy things ..that will clutter your life, buy gifts for others ..who don’t want them, to show that you make money, to fake that you’re happy, to trick yourself in to believing this lifestyle is worth it. And maybe if you feel like it, if you can afford to find time in your busy life of buying and scrolling and upgrading and consuming, find love, have a family, and enjoy life. You’ll maybe get one if you’re lucky but never all 3, not in capitalist America.
                 <br><br>

The corruption within capitalism continues to fester because the consumer actively perpetuates it, albeit unaware of the consequences, but also not willing to become educated on them. Our shopping sprees are causing a farmer's life every 30 mins, more than 6 sweatshop workers lives’ a day, and countless birth defects in millions of children. These are actual humans, that are being exploited, abused, and degraded every day of their lives and not enough people seem to care about those enduring the very serious impacts of our consumerism. The advancement of technology is supposed to help mankind yet there continues to be many of the same issues we’ve had in the past, the most atrocious one being slave labor. I used to think Hollywood was the most corrupt industry, but after this film I think fashion takes the cake.

Out of all of the articles, films and lecture videos that we have encountered in this course so far, this film, “The True Cost,” is the only one that makes me feel guilty, painful, speechless and grieves at the same time. It breaks my heart to see the chemical hazards, the dirty environment, the unsafe working place, and the minimum wage that the lower-class people from the developing countries are facing. We have to admit that this is a tragic closed-loop. However, is anyone innocent in this closed-loop? No one, not at least to my understanding, is innocent. The companies are the ones who stimulated our desire of purchasing new items; we are the ones who were easily brainwashed and agreed to purchase; the companies are the ones who ordered the production; the poor people in the developing countries are the ones who carried out the physical production process. In the end, we received the emotional fulfillment of so-called happiness; the companies received tons of profits; the vulnerable workers, however, received illness, poverty, and even deaths. Altogether, we made this tragic closed-loop happened. A change has to be made, and it is counting on every single one of us. For example, the rise of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is a good start that should be largely promoted and greatly carried out. CSR has called for changing “one bottom line” in business operation, which is the only pursuit of profit, into “triple bottom line,” which emphasizes making profits, protecting the environment and promoting social justice. After watching this film, I believe that it’s very important to have some human rights organizations like the CSR to ensure the safety, the wage, the physical and emotional wellbeing of those workers. It is a tragic closed-loop already, and now it’s time for it to break.

Man do I LOVE that Professor Hiltner had us watch one of Hasan Minhaj’s videos. He is one of my favorite comedians and while what he was saying was funny, it actually was not a joke at all. With almost all of the material we watch I feel attacked, but this hit home especially about the Zara. My whole closet is filled with Zara clothes and one of things I enjoyed most was how much new product there was. I used to work at the mall and I am aware of all the new shipments of clothes there are. I also am aware of how many products sit there and never get bought. Companies like Zara and Forever 21 and H&M always had new merchandise but I was working at Nordstom and there wasn’t much change ever. When Hasan said that these other brands have 52 different seasons I was sad but definitely not surprised. What did surprise me is that the owner of Zara is one of the richest guys around. I did not know how popular that brand is compared to other fast fashion companies as the store is a little bit more expensive. 
                 <br><br>

Another idea that was brought up was the social media influence on the products we buy. I acknowledged this idea previously. Unfortunately, our cellphones have changed the way we dress and buy. When we see someone wearing something we like, we want it too.  Once someone has seen me in an outfit, it’s as if I can’t wear it anymore ever. Therefore, you need that many more clothes if you’ve already posted in it. It never used to be like that and it’s sad. 
                 <br><br>

What is disappointing to me, is that I have been buying clothes from a company that is knowingly dumping toxic chemicals into rivers in Indonesia. The senseless environmental hazards are unacceptable and make me not want to support Amancio Ortega anymore!

“The True Cost” is an amazing film that broke my heart. Throughout the film, I found myself angered by the treatment of those who work in factories that supply clothes for fast fashion companies. One fact that shocked me was that today, we purchase around 80 billion pieces of clothing, which is 400% more than two decades ago. Industries such as the fast fashion industry fuel consumer culture and push unnecessary purchases onto consumers, which increases the demand for more goods and causes workers in factories to work more hours and in hazardous conditions in order to fulfill the demands of companies. One part of the film that was very vivid for me was the part about the protests in Cambodia. I was disgusted that the government refused to raise the wages of workers and avoided enforcement of labor laws because they were desperate to keep retail companies from relocating to countries where they could pay for cheaper goods. It amazes me that governments are willing to value monetary gain over the well being of their own citizens who help grow the economy and produce the goods that these companies want. 
                 <br><br>
One part of the film that gave me hope for the future was  the segments on Safia Minney’s company, People Tree. This company created jobs for 7000 people around the world and is a sustainable fashion brand and according to their website, is “dedicated to the principles of fair trade, covering fair wages, good working conditions, transparency, environmental best practice and gender equality.” I like that this company is not only creating sustainable goods, but also creates jobs for people; for example, Swallows, one of the producers for People Tree, created jobs for 3,000 people in Bangladesh. Companies like People Tree show that fashion can be not only sustainable and also good for not only the consumers, but also the producers.

I also found People Tree to be an extremely inspiring company whose practices should become spread worldwide to other companies to take direct part within the factories and people working there, no matter what location. This is simple human decency. Their company model provides what is lacking from other (clothing) industries who simply use the people for their extremely cheap labor without considering the health of their conditions or simply excusing it by claiming they are bettering the natives’ economy with these jobs. However, as shown with the destruction in Rana Plaza, the health of these people are constantly put endanger by the conditions they endure. This documentary “popped” my American bubble in a sense to witness the conditions of other countries that we rely on for our own lifestyles with American culture and the fashion industry being powered and supplied by them. An emotionally heavy part for myself was hearing about how some women in India (like Shima) working in the garment industry would only be able to see their children once or twice the year because of the sacrifice they make to simply give their children a better lifestyle. Of course, this isn’t exactly caused by the clothing industry but the fact this was occurring greatly saddened me, demonstrating that there is greatly a need for social change. 
                 <br><br>

I enjoyed the direction that The True Cost took as they ultimately arrived to discussion of the underlying problem of all of this, which is our economic system itself. Unknowingly or not, the capitalism of our country is not only influencing our fast fashion lifestyle but also the lives of others around the world, which only pushes the emissions of greenhouse gases and other forms of pollution as well. With the garment industry being the second most polluting industry, this reflects a need for the industry to experience change if we want to protect our planet. Some examples were depicted in the documentary with a river in India being polluted and affecting natives there to have jaundice, paralysis, and other illnesses. Even home in America, those in the agricultural industry growing cotton died from cancer at an early age due to the amount of pesticides used.

I agree with your feelings about this film and had additional reactions of disappointment with myself for not knowing about some of the tragedies that happened in Bangladesh. The Dhaka garment factory collapse killed over 1000 people and could have easily been avoided. The fact that accidents like these still happen in our modern world angers me and brings me to the words of the factory manager in Bangladesh, "People should care about people." This simple statement sounds like a belief most people should have, but the fact is that through consumers buying and wasting so much clothes along with the companies and governments that overlook safety concerns, people care more about their material goods than the lives of the people who suffer due to this. Countries and governments are supposed to protect their citizens so it shocked me when governments would knowingly ignore safety regulations along with a livable wage such as in Bangladesh and the worst offender was Cambodia, where the government fired real bullets into a crowd of protestors who wanted a fair minimum wage.
                 <br><br>
As for fault, I believe normal people can do more in buying less and wasting less to decrease the demand for clothes. This in turn will make companies produce less, but I do not blame consumers as much as I think the mass consumption is the fault of the culture and companies who push the culture of consumerism.  Humans are very social people and I think people buy so much just because it is normal and supposed to help the economy. That is why we need to change the culture because if all people know what their consumerism is costing other people, I think they will definitely buy less and live a more sustainable life.

<br><hr>
I feel the same with you about how these companies treats their labors. Just like the title “The True Cost", let us know that the true cost of buying goods is sad and scary. The new clothes you bought for your party seem to cost you $ 20, and the true cost could be someone killed by a bad and unsafe building structure. Next time you see a bright red dress, will it remind you of the blood color and the color of the person killed by it? Sounds scary? Unfortunately, this is true because Western companies treat their workforce this way. I thought it was true, only because luxury clothing is expensive, but the cheap clothing industry is the same. Whenever you buy clothes, just because it is cheap, you know that you will not wear it many times, but it is so cheap that you don't care about the price at all. Great, regardless of the price, think about the lives of the poor who work for $ 2 a day and make cloth for you for 12 hours a day. Do you still want to buy it? I like Ken talking about imaging large SUVs, living in unwanted large houses, and buying a lot of cheap cloth that is not needed. Do you feel familiar? Does it look like a typical American family now? This should not be the American Dream, it should not be a dream full of vanity and materialism.

<br><hr>
"The True Cost" was truly a heart wrenching film to watch. Like you, I felt anger, but above all, so much sadness for those who suffer so that we can have our luxuries. I had known for at least a few years now that the fashion industry had awful working conditions. When we buy clothes, we see the finished product, and all the work that went into making that shirt or pair of shoes is forgotten and erased. Companies like Forever 21 that unethically source that clothes contribute to the issue of fast fashion. 

                 <br><br>

I completely agree with your shock! It is completely insane how much of an increases has occurred in clothing sales in the span of two decades. The Cambodian protests made me so incredibly angry. The protestors are not only workers, they are human first, and have families to support and feelings. They deserve basic human rights and deserve to be paid an adequate amount for their labor. Despite this, I can also see government's point of view, although it is twisted. The real culprits are these large companies that seek laborers in foreign countries and threaten to relocate their shops in other countries who will do it for cheaper. This leaves the government in a tough position because they need the support of big companies for economic purposes. 
                 <br><br>


People Tree made me very happy and restored my hope. People deserve to be paid for their labor and to work in good working conditions. Anything less is not an option and it makes me happy that companies like People Tree are trying to fight against sweatshops in an ethical way that gives back to people.


<br><hr>

This film was truly heartbreaking. I can understand how people find it difficult to be more environmentally friendly because of delayed consequences, but when 1,000 people die as the result of consumerism?! How is this not a bigger deal? It broke my heart how workers were being physically beaten for asking for simple, basic rights. It is so incredibly wrong that women and children are forced to experience such atrocious conditions just to put food on the table. I also couldn’t believe that there were people who argued that the treatment was justified because the workers were willingly choosing to work there. Just because they’re being paid and it isn’t slavery does NOT mean that they deserve to be treated as if they aren’t human. 
                 <br><br>
However, like you mentioned, companies like People Tree give me hope. It’s a good start to changing the way our goods are produced. I’ve never personally heard of People Tree before watching this film, but the fact that they were able to employ 7,000 people was somewhat comforting. If more companies like People Tree are created, and we as consumers choose to support them, we truly do have the power to change the horrible impact of fast fashion. Also, I really do believe that if we were able to increase the amount of clothing purchased by 400% in the past two decades, then we can buy 400% less in the next two decades. I think the most important takeaway from this film is that consumers have the power to change the fast fashion industry. If we don’t support fast fashion, then it can’t successfully exist - and therefore neither can the harm that it causes.

<br><hr>
My first question after watching "The True Cost" was 'how is this allowed to happen?' then I remembered the power of lobbying, something we can't deal with within our country. What worries me is what alternative is offered to these individuals? The fast fashion industry is extremely amoral and needlessly cruel, hijacking the desire to provide a better life for one's own children into what appears to be indentured servitude. The question I have is, what will these textile workers do without these jobs? I have to believe that these people aren't doing this if it wasn't their only option... Hopefully, my beliefs are wrong and there is a good alternative to working in a death trap run by cruel taskmasters.

I like this video very much. It is humorous and thought-provoking. In the reading “the Waste Makers”, the author revealed the methods that firms used to let people consume more. In this video, the speaker talked specifically about how the fashion industry, like ZARA and H&M, puzzles people with their marketing strategies and advertising strategies. 

                 <br><br>

I felt that what they are doing is ridiculous sometimes. The speaker said that they have more than fifty seasons for a year. Nature has four seasons because the plants changed color, tides change their pattern, and the sun moves away from us. ZARA has more than fifty seasons. Does it mean that we have to change our looks and the colors more than fifty times a year because ZARA needs to sell more? The speaker also said that the environmental slogans being put on the tags are “somewhat” fake. Does this really draw the attention of people who really care about the climate crisis? I believe not. This only draws the attention of people who want to run away from the fact that their consumptions hurt the planet. Buying clothes or things with a tag that says this is environmentally friendly makes them feel better. However, if you really care, please change your consumption pattern.

The film "True Cost" truly reflects how our American buying habits do have consequences. This is tactically hidden from us to boost to capitalism and keep us buying. One thing I found interesting was how in America everything essential like education, health insurance, and housing is expensive to the point that it is almost unaffordable, but clothing is dirt cheap. This messes with our minds like we can't afford most things but we can afford a lot of clothes, so we splurge on that because it is one of the little things that we can buy. I was aware that clothing made in third world countries was made in quite poor conditions and honestly did not care much for it and still bought the cheap clothes from companies like H&M. However, after watching this and seeing that the conditions in which the clothing is made are basically inhumane, I will try not to but from such companies anymore, or at least make an effort to buy fewer items. 
                 <br><br>
Seeing the conditions in all the countries made me deeply distraught, the accidents in which over 1000 people died and they still chose to work to make money, was sorrowful. Also seeing how the chemicals and toxins released by manufacturing these items affected their health were deeply unsettling. I was not aware that whole villages and towns were full of birth defects, cancers, and other conditions. I am baffled that I was ignorant of these things, I will now try to purchase from companies that do address these issues.

I am also at fault in purchasing many clothing items from fast fashion companies such as Forever 21 and H&M. If I were to look at my entire closet, almost 98% of all my clothes come from fast fashion companies (which I now feel extremely horrible about). The conditions that these people are forced to work under are despicable and so dehumanizing. I know that the demand for these clothes are so high which does not help the situation at all because the clothes will continue to be produced in insane amounts. I believe another reason why fast fashion companies are so popular and in such high demand is due to what you said. The bare necessities such as rent, food, and bills are so expensive that people simply do not have the financial means to be able to afford good quality clothes from expensive brands made in the US. Someone struggling to make rent and keep food on the table is not going to be shopping at Nordstrom every time they need some new clothes. This is a large reason why the demand for fast fashion companies are so high. These companies give large amounts of people clothes that are in style and trendy and are sold for a price that everyone can afford and is why they are bought so often and in such large amounts.

After watching “The True Cost” documentary I felt very heart heavy due to some of the images displayed, for example the copses under all the rubble of the collapsed building in Bangladesh. I was aware of the fact that the majority of the things we buy were made outside of the U.S. and of the fact that the majority of the factories that make the produce aren’t the safest conditions to work in, but I didn’t know it got that bad. I didn’t know people got diseases from all the chemicals they work with and later dump in their water, I didn’t know people were forced to work in a building where the walls were caving in and the owners didn’t give a single shit, I didn’t know how little these people were actually paid due to U.S. companies buying the items at such a low price. Now every time I think about making another purchase, I think about the process that the item went through to get to me. How it was made in a developing country by very much underpaid people, put into a ship or a plane and transported by a van of some sort to where I live, and all of that contributes to the addition of CO2 in our atmosphere.

The best way to get the message out to the public is to target teens by using social media and apps. The reason being is that once teenagers get their hands on information, they tend to spread it over as many platforms as possible- Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Tik Tok, ect.- so that would be a good way to go about it. For example, this year when all the commotion about WWIII started, I saw it everywhere, some posts were serious and some were funny, but all in all I was fully aware of the situation. They don’t have to be these long videos, it could literally be a meme or a picture with some information on it, just something that catches the eye of a teen for them to latch on and possibly spread the word.

Hi, I totally agree with you, I was shocked in everything that I saw. This film was heartbreaking and it’s sad to say we are the main reason as to why they’re suffering. We the consumers are the ones who own thousands of clothings that are made by people in other countries under bad circumstances. The thing that surprised me was the suicide of  Indian farmers, in the last 16 years more than 250,00 deaths were recorded. That is 1 farmer every 30 mins. That is completely devastating and what makes it worse is that we don’t know about this. We don’t know about a lot of the tragedies such as the building that are not under stable conditions or the working pay rate. I remover one time I read an article saying that the workers of fashion nova are under poor conditions in the factories of Los Angeles, but I don’t think we can compare it to the people in other countries. 
                 <br><br>

You know, I was mostly amazed on the fact that people buy 80 billion, BILLION pieces of clothing yearly, that is 400 percent more than two decades ago. We are really obsessed with being in “trend” that we buy clothing that is only worn once. For example you tubers, have become so materialistic that we literally see them doing hauls and we as followers wish we can own that too.




</span></div><hr>

<p>

Although this might not have been the intent from this part of “The True Cost,” as soon as I found out that the average American buys 68 new pieces of clothing a year, I just thought not only are we irresponsible with the care of the planet, but our money as well. No one needs 68 new pieces of clothing each year. First, how do you have the room for that many items after a few years, most likely you don’t so what do these people do, either donate them to Goodwill or throw them away. Second, we could be using that money we are spending on all these “in-style” clothes on things that can actually benefit our planet. For instance we can instead use that money towards buying renewable energy appliances, of course after we have used the most we could have out of the ones we currently own. In these situations we would still be contributing to our economy if that is a concern for some people who think if we stop spending all of this money on clothes that our economy would go down; and it would help the environment more than spending our money on clothes that will end up not used to its full potential. 
                 <br><br>

Like most people, when I think of pollution I think of the greenhouse gas effect, oil spills to our oceans, driving our cars that pollute the air, etc. Thus, when I found out that the fashion industry is the second most polluting industry after oil stuns me into almost a state of complete disbelief. With all these forms of media nowadays, I’m confused how it only took me until now to know this. 
                 <br><br>

    Unfortunately but unsurprisingly, these fashion companies are putting money over people’s lives and well being. This type of mentality is assumed based on their actions alone, but to have the head of the companies outright claim that “there are a lot of worse things that” these workers “can be doing,” is out right ignorant and disrespectful. Essentially, the companies are saying that unsafe working conditions and low wages for the sweatshop workers are okay as long as the company is making a profit. 
                 <br><br>

    It’s crazy that the average American throws over 82 pounds of clothing per year, this means that 11 million pounds of clothing are thrown away every year from the US alone. I wonder if we put the amount of water that used to make the clothing item where it says the material of the clothing, if this would get more people to keep the clothing items they already have and throw away less of their clothes. Maybe then the average American would keep their clothing to the extent of its use instead of having this metatility that you always need brand new clothings so you might as well throw away the other ones.
                 <br><br>

    Instead of getting brand new clothes, we should go thrifting because as of now only 10% of these donations are actually being sold in these thrift stores. As a result, we would be indirectly helping developing nations’ economy since the extra clothing items that aren’t sold in the thrift stores are getting sent to developing countries such as Haiti. When all these clothes get sent to Haiti, clothes become a more accessible resource, causing the demand for clothes to go down in Haiti. Thus, the people in the clothing industry in Haiti are losing consumers, meaning they lose money as well. When these industries lose money, the country’s GDP is being damaged. Since the demand for clothing in Haiti is going down, those in the clothing business in Haiti have a surplus, meaning there’s an excess of supply over demand. In other words the production of clothing exceeds the consumers’ demand for clothing.

The main these or in another way to say the lifestyle that the author appeals to is the same as my lifestyle. I am a usual girl who loves to be beautiful as well. I love to have as many makeups as I can and to follow some fashion YouTuber like Jeffery star(she is the queen)….but after this video and the video from ken, I might well buy fewer cosmetics and convince my other friends to buy less.
                 <br><br>

It is true that having to makeup can let girls look prettier. But we should consider the true cost to every cosmetic we buy. Everything is two sides swords, as long as we bought the make-up to draw, we also negatively spend something on our environment as well. The carbon dioxide that emitted from the production of cosmetics. How will our sky and the air we breathe will be changed…? These impacts will just let me buy less cosmetics in the future. I will also just use less as well because I should change the public commons sense that only the girl who wear makeup is wonderful. I have my natural beauty and influence the environment in a positive way.

Film: The True Cost                 <br><br>

A lot of people who pursue fast fashion attempt to find industries in poor countries, and those industries attend to have bad environment. Meanwhile, they exploit local workers that they provide with very low salaries. And these productions and industries would contaminate environment at the same time. Stores like H&M or Zara sell these “cheap clothes” and there are really a large number of people who are into these “cheap clothes”. In such case, these series of things form a vicious cycle. In the film, “people purchase 80 billion of new clothes each year, which is 400% more than two decades ago.” Producing each one those clothes, there will be greenhouse gases emitted. I don’t think fashion is an appropriate reason for people to buy so many clothes. Also, if as people in the film say that “fashion is not something  disposable”, why they promote the public to buy new style of clothes each year and abandon what they have worn last or previous years? Such a promotion would only cause further pollution.

<p>
The film “The True Cost” shows the reality of life for people living in some developing countries. Because they need to supply enough clothes and other products to developed countries with a low cost, they suffer from a lot of things- no minimum wage, unsanitary conditions, chemical hazards, and even the collapse of the building. Because of the abnormalities in the whole industry chain, their lives are being destroyed. 
                 <br><br>


However, who should take responsibility for this situation? To consider carefully, I think everyone who attends this industry chain should all be responsible for the accidents happening in these developing countries. Just like what Ken said in this video, because people have a high demand for this item, there will be a lot of companies that want to supply for this. Because the whole market is full of competition, every supplier wants to lower its cost to earn more money without changing the price. If people demand fewer products, will companies choose to reduce the cost? No. However, this does not mean that the suppliers are innocent. If they do not advertise the fashion trend and make 52 fashion seasons, people won’t buy these items again and again without careful consideration and blindly worship fashion. Also, if they choose to produce the products at a higher quality, people will not need to buy new products at such a high speed.

                 <br><br>

Nevertheless, workers in these developing countries also need to take responsibility. If the whole fashion system breaks up and becomes simplified than before, this group of people will lose their job and even have a worse living condition than now. They have no choice but to take this job if they want to have a better environment. It seems like this kind of situation becomes a vicious cycle. 

                 <br><br>

From my perspective, this cycle cannot be solved fundamentally in a short time; however, the situation can be improved. The world, especially the developed country, should establish some organizations, which protect human rights for this vulnerable and disadvantaged group.

It is true in the film that reflects the effects of consumerism brings for both developed and developing countries, which is contrasting. I agree with your idea that everyone who attends this industry chain should be responsible for this situation.

                 <br><br>

The advertisements and the strategies that the companies used in developed countries which had already created a matured consumer culture within the time. People's needs have formed in certain ways. As Ken said in the video that Ken used cosmetics as an example. Sephora, as a cosmetic reseller, it makes hundreds of millions of dollars per year.  Their advertisements are the same as Ken describes in this video that young women who wear makeup. Now, within the development of the streaming media, such as Youtube, Tick Tok, that many people pose makeup related videos to attract people to buy products. Promotions are everywhere.

                 <br><br>

But behind this consumerism, is the suffered workers who work for low wages in developing countries. It is true that we can not stop this cycle due to today's model of the economy.  Only the owners are benefiting from this type of economy.



<br><hr>

I believe the same that to make improvements within this system won’t be as easy as many believe it to be. As you said, it will have to happen gradually, so it makes me think, will these changes at the very least happen fast enough that it could make an impact on our further worsening climate? The simple truth is that the majority of consumers are too ignorant or simply refuse to see how their consumer habits and how often they consume is only feeding into this vicious cycle you speak of. I think that any true changes with the repercussions of the “fast fashion” industry won’t come into fruition until the consumers themselves fight back against this system by putting a stop to this cycle starting with themselves first. To make a lasting change we need a big enough group of people working on informing the rest of the public.

I found this week's film “The True Cost” to be extremely interesting but also surprisingly sad. I have to admit that before watching this I didn't know to any extent how the fashion industries affected the environment or the factory workers. So with that said, I have been guilty of just buying something because it's cheap thinking “it's worth it even if I wear it once or twice”. But it is not worth it at the cost of the environment and supporting the companies that take advantage of other countries' factories and laborers. Now that I have seen this film and I am educated about the consequence of buying cheap clothing from places like Forever 21 and H&M, I will rethink those purchases. I truly think that if more people were educated about what their actions contributed to it would make them think twice about buying that $5 shirt that will only be worn once.

                 <br><br>

Also, I found the number that an average person buys over 60 pieces of clothing a year crazy. This seems like so much but things add up fast. I think this number is a huge issue. No one really needs 60 new clothing items every year, but when styles are going in and out so fast people feel the need to keep up with the constant change. In the fast fashion industry, there are now 52 seasons of fashion that happen each year. This is insane! I never would have guessed that there could be so many. Now thinking about it and how companies make consumers out of us it makes sense. I asked a friend how many seasons there were in fast fashion and she replied by saying “8”. This shows only one of the problems, many people are not even aware of this they just unconsciously follow the trends that are presented to them.

I am completely with you that I have been guilty of having the cheap mindset of “it’s worth it even if I wear it only once or twice.” Or additionally my thought process is more based on the price of an item: If an article of clothing in a store is less than ten dollars, then I’m really not questioning how much use I will get out of it as all. Now I can see this entire interaction from a completely different lens: These fast fashion corporations like Forever 21 and H&M have tricked all of us into thinking that having something new is necessary to be cool in our society. It really really isn’t. If anything, I don’t have any room for that random beanie I got on a whim, or the pair of overalls I got just for one concert. Especially with the low quality, attention grabbing items at a lot of these stores. It makes pressure to have a cool item that may cause someone to say “Oh that’s a cool fanny pack” but then you're expected to have a different one the next time you go out with that person.I recognize that I have this underlying fear that someone will come up to me and say something liek “Didn't you wear that yesterday?” or “You always wear the same three outfits.” It is so socially accepted that these are “bad” things. Why though?


<br><hr>
You know I also found "The True Cost" to be extremely sad, but not from a consumption standpoint. Sure, 52 seasons of fashion and the "60 pieces of clothing" statistic are appalling, but what really hit me was the impact all of this has on the people who create all of it. Before starting the film, I definitely was familiar with the sweat shops and the working conditions/wages associated with them. It's been the hot topic of many debates I've seen throughout high school and on TV. For some reason, however, they always seemed so foreign and abstract. No one I know is working for 10 dollars a month in a sweat shop, much less being beaten for fighting for proper wages or starving. I think this is the case for many, and exposure to similar clips that were in this documentary would be the wake up call a lot of people need.
                 <br><br>

While the consumer and production aspect of "The True Cost" wasn't all that sad for me, I did find it interesting. Like you, I never could have imagined there being 52 different seasons of fashion. I find the 8 that your friend claimed to be equally surprising, because I always thought there were 4, one for each real season. But to be honest I've never been all that into clothing or fashion. The claim that an average person buys 60 items of clothing per year definitely doesn't apply to me, and I might have 60 pieces of clothing total. I think this very similar to the idea of planned obsolescence that was discussed in this week's reading. If there are truly 52 seasons of fashion, then those who design clothing for each season are definitely aware that their product will be "out of fashion" next week. Your final statement hit the problem with this on the head. People are blindly following trends that are being set, without ever realizing their being manipulated or the implications of the trends they follow.

As a student filmmaker, I always think about how to spread a message that can make a positive change in society. I think messages can be spread through visually presented media, such as films, which include fictional films and documentaries. A fictional movie could reveal the truths unseen in a documentary and can be more attractive for the general audience. As Ken said, a full-length documentary does not attract much audience. Indeed, most box office winners are narrative and fiction. However, it is challenging to make a film that is both entertaining and educational. 
                 <br><br>
Just like most of us who do not know the real cost of cheap cloth, most people don’t know the working condition of those workers in the undeveloped country. I think people have the responsibility to spread the message by acting on themselves and influence the people around them. Such an approach may work as a trend, just like a new “fashion trend” for people to follow.

“The Ugly Cost of Fashion” was a really informative and engaging episode. The host was able to use humor as a way to keep the audience engaged all while receiving important and eye-opening facts on the fashion industry. 
                 <br><br>

I was extremely shocked to learn about dynamic assortment and the fact that there are about 52 seasons a year for fashion. When they mentioned that H&M receives new clothes 4 days a week it made me feel upset to know how wasteful that is. Once new clothes come in, they then throw out the old ones and this is a continuing cycle that happens every week in hundreds of stores. I knew there were a number of seasons of fashion but I had no idea it would be this many.
                 <br><br>

It was also upsetting to hear the number of effects the fashion industry has on our environment. It's crazy to think that textile production released more greenhouse gases than international flights and maritime shipping combined. I also was horrified when we were given the statistics of how much water it takes to make a single item of clothing and how many barrels of oil it takes too. 
                 <br><br>

I really liked it when they used clothing from H&M and Zara and put together a pop-up shop. I was just as shocked as the people in the store receiving facts about each product. I did not realize stores use made-up jargon to make it sound like the product is eco-friendly when in reality that's not even a thing. It also made me upset to see that the recycled material was only meaning the tag and not the actual product that is being purchased.

This video was very informative and gave great insight into what fast fashion is exactly. It was made to be an easy and engaging way of understanding.

The shock that comes with the discovery of how wasteful textiles actually are is key to understanding smart consumerism. Being economical as well as environmentally friendly not only entails less consumption, but smarter consumption. A single cotton T-Shirt consumes 2700 liters of water to produce. On top of that cost, the shirt must also be transported via plane, boat, or car, or any combination of the three. This is why thrifting and recycling fabric is key in reducing your footprint. 
                 <br><br>

In terms of falsifying their sustainability of products, companies should be held accountable and there should be stricter regulation on sustainable labels of clothinn items, as lying for profits is a show of terrible capitalist greed.

I also found “The Ugly Cost of Fashion” to be very engaging and informative. The host did a really good job of holding the audience’s attention. I was also shocked to learn how wasteful fast fashion chains like H&M are as they receive new clothes 4 days a week and throw away old styles to make room for the new. They are responsible for the new 52 seasons a year for fashion. I was also quite surprised to learn that the fashion industry has greater effects on the environment than international flights and shipments by sea combined. It was horrible to learn the deceptive tricks that the fashion industry uses. For example, they purposely mislead people in their informational manuals and also trick people into believing that their products are eco-friendly when really it is only the tag that is. Overall, I learned a lot from this video and the humor was a plus that made the video more enjoyable to watch.

The “True Cost” really opened my eyes to fast fashion. I always knew it was bad but I didn’t know to what extent. Anyone in the U.S. has seen the different trends and endless options for clothes in the past few years constantly changing and so in our grasp. With the amazing options for us, comes a huge, horrible side of fast fashion that consumers are not aware of. The detrimental effects for both the environment and people in 3rd world countries make me question how highly big businesses like H&M, and Zara prize their money over the health of both our earth, and the people suffering to make these clothes. Rivers in Indonesia are being entirely poisoned and drained of life just for us to buy the latest piece of clothing or accessory and throw it away in probably less than a year. It was so sad for me to learn how these big corporations have so much money, they are able to manipulate the governments in these other countries to allow them to do virtually anything they want. By manufacturing these goods in other countries, they are able to get around laws we have here, are able to pollute anything they touch, and take advantage of the poor who do not have many options for income. 
                 <br><br>
 The American Dream is a life everyone in this country strives for. The seemingly perfect life is filled with stability to success. In the rush to obtain this dream, we became obsessive consumers who are desperate for the latest, shiny thing to flash our wealth and success. By doing this, and wanting to fit in, we sacrificed quality goods for fleeting, trendy pieces of clothing. The American dream created a nightmare for other countries, where workers are treated like animals, and the environment is treated like it’s replaceable. However, I liked how the film included options for more green pieces of clothing, allowing viewers to gain information on where they could buy clothes without having such detrimental effects on both the earth and other people.

As soon as I finished this documentary, I told myself I would never buy fast fashion again. I want to know where my clothes came from and if not it’s because I bought them at a thrift shop. Nowadays, I know there are some truthful and honest brands working to fight for equality and fair working conditions. But that doesn’t mean that they are easily accessible or affordable when the focus is on quick and disposable. But, shouldn’t we also go to the root of our problem? Not only do we need to start rethinking our relationship with goods, we need to stop outsourcing labor at cheaper prices for the benefit of our own economy. People are quite literally risking their lives for the benefit of the first world countries, and as you said, the documentary really shows the extent of the process.

The film “The True Cost” truly made me emotional and brought tears to my eyes as it exposed the dark side of fashion. I am so incredibly guilty of shopping excessively and taking part in fast fashion and it truly has made me rethink what I buy and reconsider what the costs are. After watching it, I felt so angry at the fact that these corporations have so much power and dictate how we live. For the most part those are our only choices for clothing available as fast fashion controls the fashion industry and fair trade brands are only starting to take off and become available. Almost all of our fashion is made in China or Bangladesh and we feed into the cycle of exploitation by purchasing it. I am trying to check that brands I buy from have human rights code or are sustainably and ethically manufactured, but it is hard and there needs to be a top-down approach. The images that really stuck with me were the juxtaposition between the American shoppers pouring into stores and fighting over items compared to the women and children that are forced to work in horrible conditions and the people that are dying and injured as a result. It truly just disgusted me. The gluttony of oblivious Americans contrasted with peoples across the world who are dying and being exploited as a result to keep up with American greed. The entire concept is so incredibly awful. We continue to consume and discard because everything is so cheap and thus meaningless. None of the things we think are cheap are actually that cheap, we are allowed to collect and throw away items without value because of the exploited, slave-like labor that is used to create that low price. Hearing the producers attempt at justifying the working conditions by saying it is better than nothing at all and that the workers should be grateful for their generosity by offering them a job hurt to hear as it is hard to believe that people can genuinely try to justify being the cause of human rights violations and be proud of their choices. This movie made me completely re-evaluate the fashion industry as fast fashion clearly has no morale and is one of the worst industries both environmentally and socially. The system has to be changed but it is such a huge global issue it is hard to attack but needs to be addressed by the UN or through a top-down approach. The bottom-up approach isn’t enough as these workers are simply killed or injured through their oppressor’s use of force. This movie really changed how I view the clothes I buy and wear as it is something that really isn’t talked about or seen to be an issue. People don’t know what goes into the making of the $5 T-shirt we buy and throw out and that is one of the main issues. The environmental and human toll of the fashion industry are far too great to be ignored and needs to be acknowledged by the world.

I really like this comment because I think I can completely relate to it. I too find myself of shopping excessively and taking part in fast fashion. It is sad to think that I put my money into companies so terrible, especially online shopping on websites like SHEIN. I often find myself buying things I don't even need just because they are so inexpensive, so what not? I felt really guilty and upset after watching this. I like how you said, "one of the things we think are cheap are actually that cheap, we are allowed to collect and throw away items without value because of the exploited, slave-like labor that is used to create that low price." That really resonated with me because like I said before, I have purchased a lot of clothing from websites because I thought they were cheap. But when in reality, the price of these items that I didn't even need were so much higher than I thought.

I think the film explain the subject effectively by indicating the “true story” of clothing. At first, the film shows how popular the high-speed fashions are, and then demonstrate different outcomes of the high-speed fashions such as the housing collapse, chemical destroy and so on which are happened in developing countries. From my perspective, I think the people who is the casual viewers might be the film’s audience. Also, this film’s aim is to introduce the bad situation of clothing to more people who may not notice about. I think the film gives me both intellectual and emotional feelings about high-speed fashion clothing. at the beginning of the film, I thought it was going to talk about the development of the high-speed fashion clothing, but gradually I realized that it was going to describe the dark sides of the high-speed clothing. From the film, I noticed how these all kinds of high-speed fashion clothing help and destroy the developing countries from economics, health and environment. More importantly, I was shocked by the poor condition of clothing production and I think I will not purchase that amount of clothes without thinking. I definitely learn lots of new things from the film. I learnt that the people who live in developing countries had to work in such a poor clothing product condition in order to sustain their daily lives no matter children or women. In other word, this is pessimistic because even though they know how these chemical substances will hurt themselves, they still have to work for those developed countries to earn that poor amount revenue. For me, I always purchase some high-speed fashion brands such as Hollister, H&M, ZARA and so on because I do not need to pay a lot to get many types of clothes that might cost a lot in the luxury brand. However, the quality of these clothes is poor which means I will not wear them a lot and then I will throw them away which will produce tons of pollution from the people who are also like me.

“The True Cost” was truly an astonishing documentary describing the horrific facts behind the fast fashion industry. I really liked how the documentary was able to show the several horrific Bangladesh factory disasters, it is only when tragedy happens that people start to make a change. Personally, I was brainwashed by the fast fashion industry in 2018, I wanted to buy everything that is shown to me on the ads on websites, I have spent hundreds of dollars on clothes that I have only wore once or never even worn. This bring a lot of guilt as well as regret. In 2019, after being scolded by my parents and also reading about the dark history of the fashion industry, I have urged my eagerness to buy clothes as well as consumerism in general. I was never a believer of reports saying that Nike and other big brands using child labor because I thought they were supposed to represent role models of a successful industry, but now, I realized that the only successful industries are the ones that make the most profit without begin caught of their illegal behaviors. Of course, this is only the beginning, I believe after taking this course I would be much more aware of everything I am doing and the effects they would have on the environment.

This documentary truly made me reevaluate my relationship to the fast fashion industry. It's astonishing to see the great lengths to which the human race succumbs in order to be successful. To resort to child labor or developing countries to produce large quantities of a product at minimum financial cost, is disheartening. The way the fashion industry profits off the backs of millions of impoverished individuals and countries is inhumane and a crime. I have been prey to the fast fashion industry, purchasing cheap clothing and clothes I don't wear more than twice. I used to think that finding clothes that were on sale or were cheap was the best thing ever, little did I know the true cost. Taking this class has inspired me to do some soul searching, and for the better. I've become more aware of my environmental impact, whether it be the food I eat or what I wear, how it impacts the environment is always in the back of my mind. This past weekend I went thrift shopping with my cousin, and I found some amazing stuff. I think thrift shopping is not only better for the environment, but you also find some really cool stuff at a thrift shop. These items come with stories that you can only imagine. The best part is that you are helping to fight the fast fashion industry.

The True Cost served as an eyeopener to the terrible effects that my consumption choices have. It made me question my own decisions. After looking at my own closet and seeing the clothes I have versus the clothes I actually wear, I realized how many of my clothes have been replaced by new, more in fashion clothes. The older clothes end up sitting in the back of my drawers on never leaving the hanger. This film showed directly how all this excess consumption is detrimental to others. The Bangladesh factory disasters serve as an eye-catching headline that make the reader question the effects of their decisions but is just one example of all the inhumanity we cause. Brands use advertising to paint a specific picture of what their company stands for when in reality their only goal is financial progress. It is on the consumer to become more aware of brands' actions and make morally guided decisions about who they are supporting.

In the film, The True Cost, the directors take a focus on the psychological damage caused to consumers by the fast fashion industry. It was very interesting to see the processes that go into a single purchase, however, at the same time it was also incredibly perplexing. As a consumer I never thought too hard about buying new things, I would simply buy it if I liked it. After watching the film, I realized that I may not have even liked the things I was buying, but rather I was conditioned by advertisements to believe I liked them. 
                  <br><br>

This was a very hard reality to face, but the more I thought about it, the more accurate it seemed to be. In the past, I have kept up with many fashion trends by shopping around until I had recreated an outfit that was deemed “popular”. After wearing it maybe once or twice, the style eventually changed and I stopped wearing the clothes I had just bought. Sadly, these actions actually happen a lot, which makes me feel bad for taking part in it. I never thought I was that wasteful, but this film showed me just how bad my actions are for the environment.

Having already watched The True Cost before, I had the joy of watching The Ugly Truth of Fast  Fashion this week and may I say I was not disappointed! Like The True Cost, this episode of The Patriot Act takes a deeper look into the world of fast fashion and the horrific effects (both environmentally and socially) that the consumer lifestyle has produced. Unlike The True Cost, The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion did not make me feel terribly sad and actually managed to make me laugh a few times, which is surprising considering the subject of the video. I think that the comedic aspect of this video makes it very effective in conveying its core message: fast fashion is bad and we need to consume less. Don’t get me wrong, The True Cost is a great film and is very, very effective in portraying its message. However, some people may get bored or sad or uninterested and stop watching because the film is so serious and factual. That is what is great about The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion, it manages to take a pretty heavy subject and somehow make its viewers laugh while they critique the world of fast fashion. 
                  <br><br>
Personally, I would be fine with watching either of these videos because I enjoy documentaries and films similar to The True Cost. However, my sister would probably fall asleep if I tried to make her watch The True Cost and my efforts to teach her about the fast fashion industry would be thwarted! Fortunately, there are videos like The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion that draw the viewers in with humor and relatable content while teaching them about important global issues. I will definitely recommend this episode of The Patriot Act to my friends and family to watch!

After watching this movie, I was really shocked by several facts, such as how business people get the attention of consumers in various ways, how to make them naturally interested in the things they sell, and how much influence consumers have on an economic system. Nowadays, people's consumption level has steadily improved, and businesses have come up with more frequent ways to attract attention. For example, the clothing types mentioned in the four seasons of the year have been forcibly divided into 52 kinds. On average, there are new kinds of clothing to choose from almost every week, so that consumers consume more frequently and businesses can obtain more benefits More. At the same time, the merchants are also advancing with the times. For example, you just searched for any product on the Internet, opened a shopping website and had relevant push messages, or inadvertently you glanced at the advertisement in the corner of the web page, or recommended the relevant items to you when you bought an item. Anyway, many consumers may buy it as soon as they have a hot head In this way, the profit is increased for the merchants, although the possible waste is also increased.
                  <br><br>

At the same time, we also learn from the film that in addition to the business owners in the third-party clothing producing countries making money, the life of the workers is indeed very unsatisfactory, low wages, cheap and dangerous working environment and welfare, the workers do not have the right to ask for, even because the collapse of the work building causes a lot of lies and casualties, the boss does not care. Perhaps we should understand that every time we spend more money to buy, the bosses do get more income, we lose a little property, and the workers who produce these goods for us can not even guarantee the basic work safety. Maybe it's time to spend less and pay more attention to social security.

After watching the film, “The True Cost,” I was shocked to learn of the horrendous working conditions that people in poorer countries have to endure just to satisfy our need for new clothes. While I knew that working in sweatshops meant terrible conditions, I was unaware of the extent of just how bad the conditions were for these workers. The fact that America only produces 3% of its clothes domestically was just mind-boggling to me. I never knew that we outsourced that much of our clothing industry. Our country, like many others, have been taking advantage of those who are less fortunate for far too long. Not only is it depressing to see richer nations take advantage of the poor, it just isn’t right. It was infuriating to see how one woman made a comment that they should be grateful that we are providing them this opportunity to work by outsourcing our jobs to them. People like her have this mentality that they are actually helping the workers and doing good, but in reality we are basically treating them like slaves. These workers literally have no say or rights in their working environment. Any sort of resistance is met with violence and the workers are quickly silenced. Additionally, big clothing companies put pressure on businesses who make clothes by forcing them to pay their workers less and less through threats of taking their business elsewhere. As a result, they have no choice but to give in to these demands. This leads businesses to cut corners and ignore safety conditions for workers. This leads to numerous sweatshop accidents and deaths of thousands of workers.

This film made me realize that while we as consumers get what we want for cheap, low prices, these workers are suffering the most. In return for their hard labor, they barely get any form of payment, only a few meager dollars a day. Not only are they insufficiently compensated for their work, they also have to live with the environmental damage that happens as a result of our growing consumption. Their waterways and the air they breathe are polluted by toxic chemicals released in the production of goods. All in all, rich nations continue to reap the benefits, all at the expense of the poor.

I really appreciated your last sentence: “All in all, rich nations continue to reap the benefits, all at the expense of the poor.” I completely agree with that insight, and the fact that it is heartbreakingly corrupt and unjustified. After watching this film, I was also blown away at the lack of humanity our country has extended to the people doing the grunt work of all the consumption we are responsible for. Drawing from previous lectures, it is amazing that the US possesses a much smaller population compared to other countries such as Africa, but we consume exponentially more. Furthermore, we are one of the main faces of carbon emissions. We do not own up to our leading role in this environmental crisis, which as the film’s disturbing depictions of underserved workers portrays, has turned into a social crisis too. 
                  <br><br>
Connecting “The True Cost” discussion of justice to our earlier course film, “An Inconvenient Sequel”, I was reminded of what an Indian minister shared about his people’s position in a developing country compared to the affluence of the US. He explained that his workforce is simply trying to survive-make a living, in order to support their families. It is devastating that vulnerable individuals in a country with little resources have to resort to unsafe and unfair working conditions, jeopardizing their physical health and even their life. Imagine going to work everyday, knowing your efforts aren’t reflected in your paycheck, and carrying the weight of knowing you could be hurt. I really hope that our international business relations in the future feature more compassion and focus less on maximum profit.

After watching the film "The True Cost," and reading your thoughts on it, I was just as angered at the conditions wealthier countries are putting poor people at in less developed countries. I am just as surprised in the fact that the US only produces 3% of its clothes domestically. Personally, I think the US should make all, if not, most of its clothes here. If they want to supply us with all this clothes and implant this consumer culture, then they should be working under bad conditions. It isn't fair that many people around the globe are being treated like slaves in order to mass produce clothes.

People in different countries think they are being blessed with an opportunity to work here. They are getting paid just a few dollars a day for working over time all day for many days a week. I completely agree with your opinion on this film. Our country has been taking advantage of the less fortunate for far too long.
<br><Hr>
I agree with you, I was also shocked to learn about the cruel treatment imposed on laborers within the fashion industry. I never really gave thought about the process of which the clothes I wear until I watched The True Cost. It has made me to reconsider about me wanting to buy new clothes because I am now aware of the treatment of fashion workers. The true coast is the livelihood of these workers who have been environmentally disregarded by the very companies they work for. Companies enjoy setting up shop overseas because they know they can get away with the way they treat their workers. Unchecked production overseas needs to be regulated or else the continuation of the maltreatment of garment workers, along with their home, with go on. I appreciate the companies that take the time to make sure their factory workers are getting the just treatment that they deserv, unlike the companies who push it off to the side. If people,,, were more aware of the behind the scenes of the garment industry, they would still support the business. All this just to lower the cost of production in exchange for the degradation of the environment and working class.

I completely agree with your response; I was also appalled by the working conditions individuals in other countries have to face so that developed countries can continue the process of mass consumerism.  The point you brought up about how America only produces 3% of its clothes domestically was astonishing for me as well.  Although I knew a majority of clothes sold in America are not domestically made, I had no idea the extent to which this was the case.  In order to make the cost of production cheaper, companies outsource for cheap labor and materials.  This is not only detrimental to the environment but a complete misuse of power.  For so long, companies like these have taken advantage of those less fortunate, placing them in dangerous working conditions with minimal wage and no ability to speak out.  As you said, this is just another instance of the rich taking advantage of the poor.  Money-makers try to justify this practice as giving individuals in poorer countries opportunities they never would have had, but in reality, this is just an attempt to make themselves feel better about exploiting millions of people.  The working conditions workers have to endure devastate me; it makes me so sad to be part of a society that cares more about cheap meaningless articles of clothing than other human beings.
<br><Hr>
The film "The True Cost" really exposed me to the horrendous reality of sweatshops. I have already seen multiple videos and documentaries on sweatshops with people working in horrible conditions getting paid less than a dollar an hour but this documentary was also really eye-opening. To me, I find it amazing that companies such as Nike continue to have sweatshops despite how much money they are already making as a brand. It's immoral to take advantage of foreign people in the first place but to keep on doing it when your brand is already well established is cruel. Even worse, people cannot revolt because there are so many people looking for work in places such as China and India so if they demand a higher wage they will just be replaced by another worker. They even employ children! It reflects extremely badly on the United States as a consumerist society and I'm honestly shocked that quicker action has not been taken to stop this cruel process. I also find it frightening that some of the clothes I own might have been made in one of those sweatshop factories. I try to buy cheap clothes when I go to the store and I can't help but wonder if it's because of the low sweatshop wages. This issue demonstrates that although the climate crisis is also at stake because of our consumerism, our moral values are too as people are being exploited mercilessly in other countries for capitalist benefits.

Exactly! It's easy to pick out a shirt and buy it without a singular doubt in mind and we do it all the time, myself included. But when you actually think about the implications the action of buying that one shirt is, it puts into perspective how damaging even the most basic of actions seem. People are working in conditions far below subpar every day for next to nothing all so America can produce their "fast fashion" and make a fortune at the expense of thousands of lives as well as the well-being of millions. On top of that, your point about them having the face the environmental consequences of that is unfortunately too true. Again, its an issue of America exploiting others and then leaving them to suffer the ensuing consequences. Like the Indian professional that spoke about renewable energy to DiCaprio in a Climate of Doubt said, this is a problem caused by the first world that will be suffered by the third world. And finally, I want to address the comments in which people said they "should appreciate" the "opportunities" they've been given. Oh please. Just say you're classist and go about your day. No human being deserves to work in such horrendous conditions, and everyone deserves the opportunity to make a decent living. To say they should be grateful for the next to nothing that they make does nothing but highlight your privilege.

The film communicated to me in the same way; people are out there suffering in such poor conditions and brutal work just so that we can have our clothes? Seems pretty selfish on our part, and most people don't even know this. You hear about it through social media and the internet occasionally but do people ever actually look into all that much? There's a lot that Americans can't see, and that's the blood and sweat that go into the making of their clothes. Sometimes, it's even death. It's such a trap to fall into, and it's so easy to do that when we're under the spell of consumerism. People ignore the stories behind their t-shirts. No one deserves to live the lives that these people do. At the very least, they deserve a chance for a better and self-sustaining life. I never truly realized how devastating this was to them mentally and physically.

Fast fashion is devastatingly harmful to these people's lives, and we don't even realize it. It's so insane how we're so privileged here in the US, and other people are suffering just so that we can consume. We reap the benefits from the labor of the poor and that's selfish. Why should we support these companies that seem to only care for their economic value; there's absolutely no morals when it comes to mass producing clothing at the expense of others' lives. These people hardly even have rights, and like you said, they're basically being treated like slaves. That's why I think it's important to shop sustainably whenever possible. You'll find sick stuff and you'll also help not support the companies whose carbon footprint is significantly large and lack the morals to treat people like people.

I felt the same way -- the title of the movie almost says it perfectly. In the moments that we feel like we are scoring a cheap pair of jeans, we never think about how much it really cost to produce the material in front of us. The True Cost was hard for me to watch and it kind of took me a few hours to recover after watching it. This, on top of the other films and readings we have been assigned in this class, made me feel almost hopeless. While many Americans think they understand that our outsourcing methods aren't the most ethical, I don't think people really get how bad it truly is. If they did, how could they continue to buy clothes from Urban Outfitters and Nordstroms and order Nikes online? 
                  <br><br>

I was actually folding my laundry when I watched the last thirty minutes of this film and I realized this is an issue -- a huge issue -- in which I am squarely in the group of people causing damage. Many environmental issues, I feel, we can say "But I'm a student, I don't have a big house, I don't buy a lot of plastic, I don't fly often, etc. etc." But when it came to this, I had no excuses. I don't buy ethically sourced clothing. I just buy what is cheap and what I like. I feel ashamed to admit that before now, I hardly ever thought about the hands that made my clothes or the conditions under which they worked. I don't know how we can fix such a deep global crisis, but I know that sitting in my dorm re-organzing my dresser, I felt an intense to desire to just burn everything in it. I don't want to act all dramatic and hopeless, but watching things like this really affect me, and it's frustrating not knowing how to help. I guess the most basic answer is to start small and stop buying from harmful clothing corporations. While I wish I knew other ways to help these people, this has to be the best place to start.

Just like you I never truly understood the full extent to which companies in the US outsource their products and at what cost. Ti is very sad and infuriating to me on the conditions that these people work in. They are completely taken advantage of and they know this but the workers have no other choice but to still work or else they won't have enough money to feed themselves or their families. Big companies taken advantage of that need that these people have and focus their production in the those spaces, not with the intention to provide jobs but to find the cheapest labor. The comment that the woman made really got under my skin also, it really demonstrates the amount of privilege the person has had through out their life, to never have to be forced to work in a place that can cost you your life or doesn't even pay you enough to live. Many who share this mentality have luckly never experienced poverty and its not to say that the people who are working the sweatshops are lazy or don't like work, they have no there choice! That is a mistaken assumption that many people have, that the people in the workshops messed up and never chose to seek better living. Those workers are the opposite of that due to their countries being corrupt they must work, and work very hard to barely get enough money to live. I learned from this video that I must change my way of getting clothes and be more conscious on how my spending habits affect others.

As you brought up, I was also really surprised to find out that America only produces 3% of its clothes domestically. As a country that prides itself so much on being incredibly hardworking and self sufficient, it’s sad that business owners are so willing to take advantage of those who don’t have anywhere else left to turn. The American Dream is supposed to mean that anyone can be successful, but climbing to success on the backs of others is not how it should be done. I definitely will be thinking twice about where and who I’m purchasing my clothes from in the future. I’m not quite sure how I’m supposed to research which companies treat their workers with unfair working conditions, because the companies obviously don’t publicize this information. Watching documentaries like “The True Cost” is clearly a start.

The film "True Cost" was extremely interesting to me because of my deep love for clothing and fashion. To be quite honest, this movie inspired me to never want to buy something from a fast fashion label again. The first shocking detail I learned was that 97% of clothing is outsourced in countries that are still developing. These countries pay laborers extremely low wages, specifically 3$ an hour, to create clothing that is cheap and shipped around the world quickly. The conditions of these workers are horrific. Not only are the conditions horrific, the chances of disasters occurring in factories are incredibly high. One example shown in the film was the Rana Plaza disaster. After workers were disregarded for stating that the plaza had cracks and breaks in the wall, the whole center fell apart, killing and injuring a large amount of people who worked there. This is an example of environmental injustice. Situations like these are very common. What is so sad is that people order items, dont even witness the labor that is put into making them, wear the items once, and then discard them. This produces a wasteful cycle.
                  <br><br>

What is even worse, is that rather than having this cycle occur four seasons throughout the year, fashion industries have made this cycle occur 52 seasons a year. I feel ashamed that I have supported these industries for so long and am no longer attracted to stores in which items are produced like this. Second hand stores are definitely a better move but it's important to create methods that are less wasteful for the clothing that is not sold. Potentially this clothing could be recycled and given to homeless people are those who cannot afford clothing. Honestly just anything so they are not cluttered in landfills which in turn release poisonous toxins out into the atmosphere. Overall, this documentary was eye opening, and although it was graphic, showed the fashion industry in its raw form. I hope that other people feel as motivated to stop supporting this harmful industry and seek other ways to find new clothing whether that means shopping second hand, or sewing their own clothes.

I have a deep love for fashion as well but I am ashamed to say that I have, in the recent past, supported these fast fashion companies as well. I could not bear to hear critics say that the fast fashion companies are doing more good than harm and that there are jobs that are more dangerous. What this translates into for me is that "someone has to do it" and that "this is what they get". It also translates into that their jobs are worth more than their livelihoods. People should not have to sacrifice their lives for luxury, surplus, and quick production. Even if there are people who are skeptical about climate change, this is still completely inhumane, so you'd think we would all agree on this. 

                  <br><br>

Yes, this is graphic but I feel that people in the developed world are not exposed to the truth as much as they should be.  We are kept from that truth because, as Ken said, they are not in business strictly to make products but to make consumers. And that is so frightening. I was coming to this realization when I was reading The Waste Makers. There are things that I used to consume that just made me want to consume more, UNKNOWINGLY!

I learned about how the Fashion Industry uses fast fashion as a means to produce clothes as quickly as possible in my United States history class back in high school. I was also made aware of the huge costs that came about with the manufacturing of the clothing: sweatshops. We specifically looked at Nike and how the company uses sweatshops in many developing countries such as Thailand where children and many poor people make shoes for incredibly low wages. Not to mention that the appalling work conditions they are in are such as being in cramped spaces, working with toxic chemicals, and the buildings themselves are not up to code and are now safety hazards. 
                  <br><br>


It is disheartening to fathom that this is the reality and companies are not doing anything to make the change despite the workers consistently and clearly asking for it. They just do not care for their lives and only care about making money. To answer the question asked by Lucy Siegle, the London journalist about why this is the way it is, it’s simple. Fashion Industry companies are greedy. They accumulate so much wealth annually and yet for some reason they’re not able to pay their workers decent wages and cannot even provide them with their most basic rights. Most of the money the workers in the sweatshops make go right towards any bills and food, so they do not even get to keep any of it to save it towards something they desire. It is so disgusting that companies justify these means by saying these jobs are better than the fewer desirables in their country when they know these jobs are horrible as well.
                  <br><br>


I am a person who is in love with clothes and though I would not consider myself a fashion type person, I try to stay current with what is trendy. I do not go to Zara or H&M every week and buy the latest shirt, but I instead try to find clothes at thrift stores where I can make a cute outfit. I do not understand what is so wrong with thrifting: the clothes are low-priced, you can find items that still look amazing, and you’re saving the planet by buying second-hand clothes. It’s kind of like hand-me-downs by an older sibling. I hope thrifting becomes more trendy and people buy more of them since according to the short episode, The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion the average throws away over 80 lbs of clothing a year. Now with over 350 million Americans, that is so many clothes wasted every year. We can do so much better, I know we can. We just have to be conscious when making our purchases.

I was already crying 10 minutes into "The True Cost" because I couldn't believe what we have done, the suffering we have inflicted on developing countries and their people. Developed societies literally do not care at all who's lives they make profit on. How is this fair and why hasn't there been more noise made about it?? The conditions these people are working in are unacceptable! I don't understand, the workers in Bangladesh are no different than us! They're people who want a better life and it's truly not their fault that they were born in the country they were, that could've been any one of us but we somehow got "lucky" to live here because regardless of how messed up our culture is, we do not have it as bad as people living in 3rd world countries. I cannot imagine how sad it would be to live their life, the frustration I would feel to have to work all day and only make $2, the fury I'd feel towards the big companies that don't pay a fair price for their products to be made, I cannot imagine living like those in Cambodia, where law enforcement beats you to death so that you can shut up about wanting a fair wage and decent living conditions. How is it that we're living in this era of prosperity and we don't stop to think of the people who are behind our high production demand. How can we demand so much and not feel guilty? I don't understand.
                  <br><br>
How can we expect these societies to thrive and develop if what we demand them to do only worsens the environment they live in? Contaminated soil, air, and water only results in sickness and illnesses of the present and future generations, we are literally making them work until they can't no more, until they fall dead because their water has been contaminated with chromium or because their management didn't ensure their workplace was safe. I don't know how these people do it, I wonder what hope do they hold onto because I honestly feel that I wouldn't be able to live like that and I'd probably consider suicide. That's how bad it is and it makes me so mad that I can't do more to help them. Like Shima said, what we wear, is produced by their blood. The incident of Rana Plaza where more than 1,000 people died is just horrifying, to know that it could've been prevented is infuriating, and to know that these large companies aren't planning on changing is simply satanic. How could we let our own global citizens live in such toxic conditions and live in fear of dying this way due to fast fashion? We're failing as a global community.

"The True Cost" does a fantastic job displaying the horrible truths behind the fast fashion industry. I think the most impactful parts of the film were those in which they traveled to other countries, and showed the direct effect that the fast fashion industry has on the lives of people that work in it. Hearing the story of the woman who tried to get better regulations in her factory, only to be beaten by her bosses and other workers was a truly a hard one to hear. Along with this,  the showing of  horrible, inhumane conditions in which workers are forced to work stuck with me. I could immediately think of examples of fast fashion companies that I, ashamedly, have bought.For example, a store like Brandy Melville sells one shirt in a certain style for $15. But, Forever21 sells one just like it for $7. Or online fashion stores such as ROMWE will sell it for $3. We have to realize that the people making these shirts are getting paid less than what we pay for the shirt. 
                  <br><br>

I myself have fallen into the vicious cycle of fast fashion. Prior to reaching middle school, I did not shop for clothes very often. My parents buying of clothes for us kids was similar to that of the 2 month season cycle. Upon reaching middle school, I realized that other girls were not doing this. As I got older, it became more and more evident that the more clothes and styles you had, the cooler you were. Of course, I began wanting to fit in, and doing so meant buying more clothes more often. I followed this trend through high school, until my senior year, when we learned about fast fashion in my AP government class. Since then, I try to mostly spend my money at thrift stores, and only when I truly need them. This of course is still something I struggle to follow, and watching the "True Cost" only strengthened my urge to stick to my plan. 
                  <br><br>

I think the information about how many clothes are actually not donated, but rather trashed because donation piles are overflowing is a clear indication of our overconsumption. I wish this information about fast fashion was more readily available to the public,becausreI feel although it could make a major difference. We need make sustainable fashion popular.

What also made me very upset when watching "The True Cost" was the fact that I have been unknowingly perpetuating this system for so long without my knowledge.  From a young age, I have bought into the fast fashion trends that ended up dominated my self worth because I was constantly comparing myself to what others were wearing and how I could look like them.  My identity was wrapped up in the culture of constantly having to look the "trendiest" and keep up with the latest styles because the fashion industry trained me from such a young age that fulfillment and happiness come at a price.  But luckily for me, that price was getting lower and lower! 

                  <br><br>

All the while, there are people working for $2-$3 dollars a day in terrible conditions so that I can buy a pair of jeans for $10 so that I wouldn't feel bad about throwing them away when they would inevitably rip after a few wears.  The whole process of the fast fashion industry was appalling to see and made me reevaluate my entire life and the culture of America.  From the big industries that had a monopoly on both the fertilizers and the seeds to grow the cotton that would put farmers in so much debt that there is an enormous epidemic of farmer suicides, to the amount of waste that is accumulated and the environmental impacts on the water sources and soil of these developing countries.  I had to pause the movie a few times to really consider the cost of my actions.  The cost of unsafe working conditions and building that are not up to code that can and have ended up falling and killing hundreds of innocent workers.  The cost of ruining the textile industry in countries that have an overabundance of donated clothes.  The cost of thousands of kids with physical and mental ailments.  Not enough Americans take the time to think about how their actions are affecting other people, and I think that more people need to be conscious of the choices that they are making because every decision that we make has dire repercussions to other people.  More people need to ask themselves if buying a lot of cheap clothing worth all of the destruction that it has on other peoples lives, health, and environments.

<br><hr>
You're comment on your parents purchasing clothes for us when we were younger just reminds me of my own experiences. I've always hated shopping, so my mother would buy me clothes in-spite of my stubbornness, probably for a little longer than I'd like to admit. Perhaps I wasn't directly falling into the grips of fast fashion, but i was still participating, as those clothes my mother would get me, I wouldn't even like. I'd tell her they were great in order to get her to leave me alone and make her feel as though her efforts were worth something, however in the end some of those clothes remain hanging in my closet to this day.
                  <br><br>
I always figured donating those clothes was worth something as well, but no matter what it's still perpetuating harm to the environment. Your thrifting is quite admirable, as it truly seems to be the only guilt-free mode of spending for our clothing.

I really agree with you that the film “The True Cost” reveals many horrible truths behind the fast fashion industry that we don’t know. I was very shocked by the fact that in the 1960s, the American produced 95% of the clothes its people wore, while in the 2010s only 3% is produced in the US, with the rest produced in developing countries. Operating factories in developing countries like China, India, and Indonesia, the owners of these companies minimize costs and maximize profits by letting factories in these developing countries compete against each other. The owner will put pressure on these factories, threatening them if they don’t lower their price, they will move the factories to other countries. The factories, in turn, pressure their workers. This could be shown in two things: worker wages and working conditions. According to Morgan, although the fast fashion industry is making a huge profit like three-trillion-dollar per year, the working conditions in these countries are poor. Like you said in your comment, a woman who tried to get better regulations in her factory, only to be beaten by her bosses. There is another example in the film. The film shows before the commercial building named Rana Plaza collapsed, workers had been forced into the factory even though a crack was seen in the walls. In many developing countries, workers have to work in hot, crowded, and structurally unstable buildings. These workers not only have low salaries but also are experiencing life risk. I feel the same way as you do, I also feel so bad about the horrible and inhumane conditions the workers are forced to work in. Also, I feel ashamed that I have bought so many clothes from fast fashion companies.

Watching this documentary; “The True Cost”, had me in a mix of emotions. The way people in these developing countries are literally exploited just so we can have cheap clothing is upsetting. I felt really bad and upset because I am contributing to their exploitation. I mean I know it isn’t directly my fault but I always try buying the cheapest clothes and never think about where it is coming from nor who has made it. I know there was a part where they tried to make the situation less harsh by saying that people are getting paid better than other jobs there but, these huge corporations with probably billions of dollars are exploiting people just to increase they’re already enormous wealth. Nothing can justify how they are treating these workers. 
                  <br><br>
The most upsetting part of this documentary was when they talked about the Rana Plaza tragedy. 1,000 workers were killed just because the factory owners decided to ignore the warning given to them by both the workers themselves and building managers(not too sure about who but they were warned). And, the fact that the year this happened was the most profitable was even more repulsive. We care more about making money than people's lives, I literally cannot process how we can be so inhumane towards their situation. 
                  <br><br>
The last important thing about the documentary was also the fact that these brands are free from any responsibility to these workers because they don’t directly employ them. They go to these developing countries demanding for the cheapest prices, pretty much forcing these factories to agree to the price if not then they don’t get work. And still these brands take no responsibility whatsoever about what happens to workers. Don’t care if they’re being exploited or not, being beaten by factory workers because they decide to ask for better treatment, and risking their lives in these cracked buildings just because they need the little money given to support themselves. I don’t even have the words to explain how disgusting and horrible it was watching and thinking about how these people are treated.

I completely agree with your comment. Watching this video made me feel many things, but it mostly made me feel guilty. I buy stuff from forever 21 all the time, and to see how clothing from fast-fashion retailers is actually made is quite terrifying. However, it was interesting to see this because although I was aware of the horrors of the fast fashion industry, I didn't know the extent of the exploitation and just how horrible the industry really is. 
                  <br><br>
I, too, was surprised to learn about the Raza Plaza tragedy. It's crazy to know that these places were aware of what was happening as far as infrastructure but didn't take any action.
                  <br><br>
The main take away I have after watching this film is knowledge. I no longer will allow myself to buy things from fast fashion retailers. Yes, the clothing may be cheap, but it doesn't make up for the fact that innocent people are losing their lives over them.


<br><hr>
I feel the same way about feeling terrible for contributing to the exploitation of thousands of people, just so I can buy cheap clothes. Before watching this film, I've always thought that sweatshops were a thing of the past, something that was common decades ago during the industrial revolution, but were done away with as time went on. The truth is, they're far from gone, they're just hidden from us to free us from the guilt of buying things we don't need. The same is true for the farmers who would kill themselves after being exploited by an industry far more powerful than any one individual. 
                  <br><br>
While corporations continue to ruin people's lives for profit, we let them continue this behavior by consuming because why buy things for more, when you can get it cheaper? I think the only way to solve this issue is for more people to get involved and get the attention of lawmakers and others in power. If we can vote and impose more regulations protecting workers, we can make an impact on the industry for the better.
<br><hr>
I agree with your comment. As a college student, you are always going for the cheapest option. I know that every time I buy a cheap piece of clothing I don't think about where it comes from, I just relish the fact that I got it cheap. It makes me upset to think about where these clothes are actually coming from. I'm over here excited because I paid under 6 dollars for a t-shirt, while the person that made it is actually getting pennies to make that product. 
                  <br><br>

It's disgusting to learn about how these factory workers are actually treated. Per the comment above you talked about the 1000 workers that lost their lives when and then still had the most profitable year. Think of all the people in America that bought those items not knowing that someone had actually died in the making. The person was most likely also relishing the fact that it was cheap.  
                  <br><br>
these big brands not having any guilt over what happens to their employees because they don't actually employ them is sickening. The brands have to take no responsibility meanwhile people are over here literally dying while the business gets richer and richer.

Having already seen both "The True Cost" and "The Ugly Cost of Fashion", I chose to watch "The Ugly Cost of Fast Fashion" again.  The last time I watched this film was in my Junior year of high school and it was surprising how much  I had forgotten.  I still remembered the premise of how the U.S. fashion industry was built on exploitation of the poorer countries, but I forgot just how bad it was.  
                  <br><br>


Even though we may look at the sweat shops and mass factories in other countries and say "that's bad they need to fix that", what we are missing is our own responsibility for the situation.  Our culture is so obsessed with cheap and plentiful clothing that there is next to no profit margin for the companies selling the goods.  In order to turn any amount of profit, the companies must get cheap bids from factories in developing countries, which inherently hurts those factory workers.   Many of the owners feel guilty about the working conditions and wages, but they have no choice.  If they were to raise standards to a basic standard of living, the price would be higher and no company would accept a contract with them.  
                  <br><br>


If this doesn't strike you as profoundly wrong, then I do not know what will.  The next time you want to go buy a new shirt or outfit from a store, seriously consider whether or not you need this purchase.  Think about how much you will use the item and unless the answer is for a long time, you should probably pass on it.  Even though it will not directly solve the problem, you will no longer be complacently supporting an industry that results in many deaths a year and governments shooting down their own people for demanding a basic standard of living.

I agree that consumers should be shouldering some responsibility in this matter. We have been too obsessed with buying new things simply because that are cheap or on sale. However, I still believe it it mostly the fault of the companies. I get that the "invisible hand" of the market drives the companies to choose the lowest cost manufacturers, but they should at least allow for livable conditions. Yes, I agree that it isn't the factory owner's fault in the end, as they are also trying to survive. The companies should be making a change from their end.
                  <br><br>
All in all, changes should be made all along the chain, from factories to consumers, but I still believe the fast fashion companies should shoulder the largest burden.

<br><hr>
Like you said, it’s pretty interesting to see how much of the U.S. fashion industry was built upon the backs of other countries. Sweatshops and other brutal working conditions are not really the product of the country’s they reside in, but the countries that they supply- particularly the U.S. It’s not shocking considering our history though that our forms of oppression like slavery and imperialism have not gone away, but rather have evolved. Yesterday it was cotton-picking, today it is outsourced fast fashion. This is the cost of capitalism, and unfortunately it is not brought upon those who benefit from it. 
                     <br><br>
  Like Ken said, these industries, (in the case he mentioned cosmetics), are fueled by consumption. The reason cheap, fast fashion sites like Zaful, Shein, or Romwe survive and have massively grown today is because of their ability to charge such cheap prices. Of course this is because of the inexpensive (and in humane) way that they make their products, but nonetheless they attract a huge market of people who want affordable clothing. The market that they reach is massive and ever growing meaning that there is no end in site for these types of companies. 
                      <br><br>
 Also, interesting to note I think is Ken’s mention of Thoreau and how ahead of his time he was in terms of predicting the goals of the fashion industry. It’s interesting to think sometimes of how different our world and culture would be if his advice had been listened to.

This Film has made me feel worse about clothes. I had no knowledge that third world countries are producing that much clothing for the USA.  I mean I just started thinking of all these places as cool, but really they are doing drastically awful things to people around the world. Not only are we treating third world countries with CO2 emissions, but we are also giving them a hard time at there jobs and taking their resources. People die in factories from fires, don't get paid enough to support their families, and cannot even protest because they will be run down by the police in their countries. When I also see the pollution that is put inside the waters and ocean I literally cannot take the sight of it. Seeing all that waste of gray and lumpy water going into our oceans is disgusting. Luckily, I have heard that Fast fashion is starting to disappear which makes me really happy. We are finally realizing that you don't need to get new clothing every season.  I just hope as Americans, we realize what we are doing is wrong and hopefully can change. But, will I and everyone keep their word or am I just saying it to be a good person? That's the question I ask myself.

This film made the detrimental effects of the fast fashion industry visible to the ones who consume their products. I had heard about the Rana Plaza disaster when it occurred, but being only 11 at the time, I didn’t understand its great implications on the American lifestyle. Watching this documentary allowed me to see those who work in the fast fashion industry in a more personal way. Not that I wasn’t empathetic to the awful conditions people that people were subject to, but I was able to understand them and recognize the part I play in this evil system.
                     <br><br>


Last August, I decided that I was only going to buy clothes second-hand for the rest of the calendar year, meaning only purchasing from thrift stores, consignment stores, or online second hand clothing shops. I made this choice because I vaguely knew that fast fashion was bad for the environment and the people employed by that industry. I also knew that not purchasing brand new items was good for my bank account. Both of these reasons contributed, but I didn’t really know much about the scope of the larger issue. I followed through with this goal for the most part, though I received clothes as gifts for the holidays. Overall, I found that I spent less money and bought clothes that I liked more. But as soon as the new year rolled around, I allowed myself to buy new items from retail stores. 

                     <br><br>

Immediately after watching The True Cost, I began researching clothing brands that were fair trade certified. I decided that I only want to buy clothes that are ethically sourced and environmentally friendly. I wanted to make sure that the clothing I was wearing was made by people who are given sustainable and livable wages, such as People Tree.

The truth of fast fashion as Hasan Minhaj states is that $1.1 trillion is spent with the average American spending 68 articles of clothing per year. This can also translate to 350 million Americans times 80 pounds of clothes. The amount people spend to “look trendy” is ridiculous as the stigma behind fast fashion only produces temporary usage which will end up as waste later on. Every three days the Salvation Army gets eighteen tons of clothing which even after donating majorly (87%) goes to the landfills in Africa and Kenya for waste. In my experience, I know that plain colored things will last longer than those that have designs on them because it remains a classic, timeless article of clothing. 70 % of ancient wood and 33% of ancient forests get invaded for the sake of clothing manufacturing. The chemical processes poisons the Earth such as the Citarum River in Indonesia which impacts children that live near these factories to have liver problems. Children are “not supposed to have liver problems” at such a young age considering the fact that they are more on average physically active during childhood. Upon being informed about major fast fashion companies like Zara, I was not surprised to find out that consumers are targeted for the vision of wealth. The present world is so focused on the elite that we often tend to forget what makes us individually happy other than becoming emotionally attached to materialistic wealth. It made me rethink resourcefulness in hand with satisfaction.

After watching this week’s film, “The True Cost,” I felt as though I contribute a little too much then I should to the unhealthy consumerism ways that support these big companies. I would not go as far to say that I am chasing more, but more so mindlessly purchasing more as time goes on even if I do not need more. The film mentioned how these large business owners are able to use tactics to reach the public in a way that tells them to buy more. This is very unfortunate as the more we buy the more waste that enters the world and the worse the environment gets. Unfortunately, I can assume that many of these business owners care very little for the environment as all they tend to see is how much money they are receiving always wanting more. I found it interesting how fast fashion has changed society over the couple years making things more accessible and conveniently priced for the consumer. Companies have even begun to sell things online more because of how easy it is to just click a few buttons and be able to receive it at your doorstep. As fast fashion obviously has its upsides, people do not bother to pay attention to the problems that it brings. As fast fashion grows workers from other countries continue to become exploited for their service by not receiving fair pay, or even a properly functioning work site. This is simply unethical and flat out wrong to do, but the companies do not have a problem if it means they continue to grow. Secondly, the damage it is doing to our environment by using pesticides to grow cotton and creating more waste on the planet never gets taken into account. Although this is not a reply to another student, I saw a comment on this movie that really stuck with me that I felt like I had to repeat. This comment was that when we think of climate crisis so many issues come to our head like sea level rise, beef industry, fracking, and so much more. I personally think this way and until I took this class do not reason the damage that fast fashion also does and I feel like I am not alone in that way of thinking. Fast fashion is certainly something that must be addressed as it is only continuing to get worse. 
                      <br><br>

I took this film a bit personal as I definitely buy from fast fashion, the majority of it being online purchases. As I watched the film I realized how targeted I am being from these large corporations that are constantly advertising to me to buy more. This film was an eye opening experience as I am now able to understand the negative effects of the fast fashion industry and truly see how they outweigh the good. How I will not stand for unethical work environments for those who already struggle daily to the damage it is doing to our planet. I also realise that the more I buy from them the poorer I become and the richer they become which is exactly what these companies want. I am grateful I was able to see this wonderful film as it is one that I will certainly take to heart and act quickly on.

We definitely do contribute to a consumer driven lifestyle, even if not on purpose. Truthfully I feel like the main reason is our lack of public knowledge that we contribute so negatively to our environment in terms of fast fashion. Companies make things easy, we have quick and cheap ways to achieve clothes with a few clicks and because of the convenience we neglect the effects made. Large corporations do not encourage less co2 because 97% of clothes are made outside of the U.S. In addition to that, the fact that China and Bangladesh because transporting the clothes to the U.S also creates more CO2. The extreme working conditions that we make people endure shows that if we do not care about people making 3 dollars a day, why would we care about making more CO2. Fast fashion when brought up confused me because I understood the human rights part of it but not the damage fast fashion does to our environment. Truthfully when thinking about causes to our climate crisis we tend to neglect other things besides fracking, the beef industry and transportation. But fast fashion adds is the opposite of our minalmilist ways, we neglect many other ways we take advantage of our Earth and natural resources as well. Fast fashion adds to our climate crisis in ways that so many do not and cannot see.
                      <br><br>

I also- now shamefully- bought from fast fashion and truthfully buy from fast fashion and was not informed on how detrimental my actions were to the Earth. We are being targeted by large corporations and even societal norms that encourage a fast fashion and consumerist lifestyle. Change is difficult because change would make life a lot more difficult and there is nothing Americans hate if not efficient and fast. Our knowledge encourages me to improve our lifestyle but change is not easy when fast fashion is integrated so much into our society. This film really opened my eyes and left me ashamed on what we have done as consumers but I feel as though baby steps are still movement and as long as we begin trying, change will be easier.

The Ugly Truth Of Fast Fashion
                       <br><br>

As the video holds the similar main idea with The True Cost, I get clear conception about the real cost from consuming. We are not costing the money we have, but also the materials that create the goods, the environment, and our idea about products. In the other word, we are wasting those resources because the companies keep conveying the idea about fast fashion in purchasing new products much often. Rephrasing from the professor, industries do not serve for us, we serve for them. That is pretty fearful when you think about it. If we trace back, we can easily find the advertisement made big percentage of contribution for leading the potential consuming. The fashion cloth trend on the advertisement is pushing and chasing us to purchase the new goods as a big quantity. It is a total disaster for the environment because the more unnecessary goods are made, the huge damage is caused towards the environment.

"The True Cost" probably is one of the assigned movies that I really feel related to our daily life. It is shocking to learn what is the truth behind of fast fashion such as H&M. I guess all of my classmates have at least couple of clothes from brands for example H&M, forever 21, or unique, but we have never thought of what is the true cost behind the cheap prices. It seems to be 'affordable' to everybody, however, is the price behind it really affordable to our conscience? It is hard to see mothers losing their kids, babies losing their parents in a disaster happened in Rana Plaza. Dozens of people contributed to clothing manufacture died there and it is  unbelievable that this is actually an event which is totally avoidable, but the company chose to ignore the reported issue and put their interest on the top of their employees' lives. Seeing kids born with disability is another fact hard to image, industrial pollution has cost so much on family living in poorer countries. We are enjoying the 'affordable' clothes in developed countries, but on contrast, there are mothers waiting their kids to die hopelessly in poor countries. It is depressed to see the interviewee saying that 'people are wearing clothes made of our blood' and uncontrollably crying and saying 'I don't want people to wear clothes made of our blood'. What is the truth price behind the high fashion? The answer is not 10 dollar for T-shirts you can buy everywhere, but the flesh and blood of those workers who have to leave their children behind and work for other people's greediness.

Out of all of the films we've watched in this class thus far, I also feel the most connected to "The True Cost". Everyone is guilty of owning at least one fast fashion item because no one looks at a cheap t-shirt and think about the blood, sweat, and tears that unjustly went into making the said t-shirt, at least someone who has not been educated on how fast fashion processes. The most disappointing part of all of this is that it can be avoided if people in developed countries took the time to understand where they're clothes are coming from and why they are so cheap. Someone saving a couple dollars on a crappy t-shirt in one country means that a young woman has to give up her children, her free will, and her health in another country. Disasters like Rana Plaza will continue to happen unless developed countries take a step back and consider where their clothes are coming from, and companies like H&M and Forever 21 are held accountable for their crimes.

As someone who has an abundant amount of clothing and belongings, the thought of the true cost behind my clothing weighed heavily on my conscious. Like you, I really started questioning the amount of people that had lost something because of my clothing.  Like the woman who was being interviewed through the film said, no one should be wearing anyone’s blood. I do not want to turn a blind eye to these things anymore. I think with issues like climate change and dehumanization of garment workers, humans in more developed nation turn our heads to  it because we aren’t directly affected by it. This film showed hundreds of people dying in building collapses and humans beings being murdered because of clothing. It really did create an impact in me. The same goes for food. I saw in the film the woman who lost her husband at 50 year old because he worked in agriculture and was always surrounded by chemicals. I can only imagine that if it affect the workers, then it will also affect the consumers. The film made me feel heartbroken and truthfully, ashamed to be an American. Often times, the United States is coined as one of the greatest countries but yet, we turn to the dehumanization and unethical treatment of humans, despite all the resources we have to be better. This film made it clear to me that we still have a long way to go as a country. Like the researchers in the film stated, we have to question the systems in our country and revise them in a way that they are fair and efficient. Since watching the film, I’ve genuinely been trying to stop supporting fast fashion brands. However, its difficult. Hopefully, as the film predicts, there will be a massive shift in the market for ethical and sustainable clothing in around 10 years and not everything will center around only making money.
<br><hr>
"The True Cost" was a sad but informative film that I believe everyone should be aware of. From all the other films this film really touched my heart and made me frustrated with the industries profiting an abundance of money from us. Before I would hear from many people that you shouldn't buy too many clothes because it's bad for the environment but I never really understood why. All I knew was the surface level facts that people told me. Now after watching this film, I am able to realize that the fast industry issues go far beyond just environmental issues but also dehumanization. American people take for granted that there are many people in places like China, India and other low-income places that are suffering financially and physically to make all of the clothes we wear. Like you mentioned it was devastating seeing all the mothers losing their kids and family members in the collapse of Rana Plaza caused by the company being careless about their workers and ignoring the worker's concerns of the building having visible cracks. In the end, the building was not suitable for working conditions anymore but workers were exploited of their labor work which in result literally ended in their tragic death. The fact that most companies and mass fashion industries barely care about the workers putting in all the hard and long hours of work into making clothes for people all over the world is unexplainable to me. The only thing these companies care about is advertising their products for us the navie to make a crazy amount of profit. We keep on buying their clothes because we want to follow trends and we fall into believing their clothes are actually affordable making us buy more and as a result hurting the environment by leaving our old undegradable clothes in landfills that produce dangerous CO2 gases. Like you mentioned we are acting greedy and we don't take into consideration that people making our clothes are left to take all the suffering and they are not being treated or paid the right amount they deserve. Hopefully, this changes and our economic world can stop making everything about money and start acknowledging the working low-income class more.
<br><hr>
I feel the same about your point that "The True Cost" is the movie that relates to our life the most. I like buying clothes from H&M and Forever 21. They are cheap so the price lures you to buy them again and again, often getting unnecessary ones, like for different parties. I haven’t been aware of the fast fashion that is happening all around the world right now until I watched this film. Because of consumerism, companies like H&M want to be more and more competitive, so they want to keep the price of their products low. The Global Value Chain helps them get there. These big companies subcontracted factories in developing poor countries like those in south Asia, and their cost on production is lower and lower in the expense of the poorer and poorer working conditions for the employees of the factories.  Just like what you said, the disasters of the factories in India could be prevented if the boss who owned the factories informed their employees earliers, stopping them from creating one more shirt. Also, the pollution created by those factories is released into the environment in which the people of those countries live. And the pollution has harmed them a lot, like disabilities for the youth and the elders. So the “true cost” behind all those cheap clothes we buy is actually the “flesh and blood” of the people who work for the fast fashion. I think we should really change the way we buy things and lower the consumption so the big companies can truly realize their mistakes.


<br><hr>
I honestly see this film, “The True Cost”, as another way that we in the developed world turn a blind eye to our impacts on the rest of the world, and its vulnerable populations. We want things as cheap as we can get them, so we have worked to squeeze as much as we can out of other parts of the world for our own benefit. When we create a system like this, we are both causing direct harm to people – those who make clothes, and those who must live in the pollution it causes, as well as those effected most gravely by the climate impacts of the fashion industry. But, sadly, I don’t think its very off-brand. This is the kind of exploitative system that we use to do most things within our economy: make everything as cheap as physically possible and push any negative side effects, intentional or otherwise, onto those who can do nothing about them.

Watching the film The True Cost truly broke my heart. I think that this film might be one of the most powerful films that we have watched in this class so far. It is so raw and real, and I feel like, as the audience, we almost don’t want to believe that this is real. We don’t want to believe that people are actually living like this. We don’t want to believe that people are dying everyday just so that consumerism can thrive in America. What stood out the most to me, and probably did for a lot of people, was being shown how the workers in the sweatshops were being treated and hearing the first hand experiences. The fact that the workers in Bangladesh were complaining about the work conditions and showing concern of the cracks in the building to management still results in the collapse of a building and hundreds dead because no one cared to listen. The people of Cambodia protested to raise the minimum wage and people were being shot, and beaten, covered in blood, while everyone continued to protest with tears running down their face. Hearing the parent’s concern of the safety of their child and having to worry about their children developing a disease is just terrible. Living in America, I can’t even comprehend those kinds of struggles. I can’t even put myself in their shoes and I hate that. America is using these people from third world countries as their slaves. They work long days, dangerous and deadly conditions, sacrifice their life, and barely get paid. This is all so that I can go down to the mall and buy a couple of cheap shirts that I will probably stop wearing and throw away and in a few years. And then what? Then, those shirts just sit for 200+ years in landfills, releasing poisonous chemicals into the atmosphere as they sit. Then I can just do the same thing over and over, supporting the Fast Fashion Industry and supporting slave labor. This is absolutely repulsing and I wish that I had seen this film sooner because I would have changed the way I shopped a long time ago. But now, I can never shop the same. This film convinced me to stop buying my clothes from this industry within the first ten minutes of me watching it.

Unlike my reaction to the previous lectures on air travel and automobiles, this film made me optimistic that something could be done to address the climate crisis. While many commenters viewed this film as depressing since it primarily portrays how people are so captivated by the fast-fashion industry, I think that shifting cultural views on clothing and consumerism is easier than in regards to the aforementioned means of transportation. In the film, one of the primary points was that the fast-fashion phenomenon is new, claiming that previously fashion trends were seasonal and that recent brands that have gained popularity introduced this new way of marketing clothing. For this reason, I see the wholehearted embrace of fast-fashion by such a large portion of the population in a short period of time as an indicator that a cultural shift in the opposite direction has the possibility of causing a similarily drastic and widespread change in behavior. I think it is clear that people's embrace of fast-fashion and the over-consumption of clothes is based on copying the behavior of celebrities and what they learn from popular culture. If we can create a culture shift and have cultural leaders set a different example I have no doubt people will shift their behavior to be in line with the new standard. 
<br><br>
Another reason I am more optimistic in addressing this aspect of the climate crisis is rooted in my own bias and experience. I have never been a fan of shopping and I only purchase new clothes when they're rendered functionally useless. I'm not a follower of fashion and I have never really understood people's obsession with keeping up with the latest trends. For that reason, I am inclined to believe other people can learn to be similarly apathetic towards fashion. For me, I am more optimistic about this because my lifestyle would have had to change drastically to comply with previous recommendations about air travel and automobiles but I am already living according to recommendations regarding purchasing clothes. While we need to change our lifestyles across the board in order to seriously address this crisis, I really think ending our societal addiction to fast-fashion is realistically achievable.

After watching "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" I found this approach to informing the public about dangers to the environment a good tactic. Someone like Hasan Minhaj who has a large viewing being able to reach out to his audience through comedy about serious topics such as consumerism, the fashion industry, and its impact on the environment. These topics on their own can be very difficult for some people to want to listen to or deal with often thinking these to topics to be too "heavy" but by using comedy, Minhaj is able to capture people's attention through jokes that still deal with very serious issues. By making jokes he somehow is able to spread the message that the truth behind fast fashion and its environmental implications are no joke at all. It makes people laugh at one second and then critically reevaluate their choices the next. 
  <br><br>
  After week four and this week's readings and videos, it has really made me assess my habits as a consumer. As I walk past stores in Downtown and see appealing clothes, now I will think- will owning this truly make me happy? The answer is no and I also will not feel at peace wearing that item knowing the environmental impacts it has. It is also making me reevaluate clothing brands I assumed to be "eco-friendly" just because they only gave themselves a label that legally has no real definition. Now when I do shop, and hopefully that is only if I absolutely need something(which is not likely),  I will put more effort into knowing the brand's background and the effect purchasing this item will have on both myself and the environment.

In the age of consumerism, we really need to think hard about what the costs are. The true cost is the world we live in, the environment, and even the lives of some people.
  <br><br>

When I saw that so many clothing factory workers died due to factory owner and capitalist’s contempt for their lives, I felt chilling that clothes that I wear everyday were made upon those workers’ blood. Obviously, that’s not worth it. However, those fast fashion companies, like Zara and H&M, don’t care about the workers, instead they only put focus on whether they can get even cheaper clothes for greater profit. When we enjoy the cheapness and throw tops that we only wear once, we are wasting more than our money and natural resources, but also the lives of workers.
  <br><br>

While fast fashion not only costs people’s lives, but also costs our planet. When majority people do not realize the serious consequences of such express consumption, it has already caused many to suffer. Waste water from the production of clothes is poured into rivers that people of poor countries live by. Many of them sicken after drinking polluted water. When I get angry and indignant that the “developed world “consume marginalized people's lives for their own benefit, I suddenly realize that it will pay the piper one day. Although developed countries can move heavy pollution and garbage heaps to the developing or poor countries, they can not escape the danger after a natural cycle. Climate crisis is a global issue that is closely related with each person.

Watching the film The True Cost was incredibly eye-opening to the true costs in the process of production. Something that really stuck out to me during the film is when one of the factory workers commented she wished that the fashion industry could produce and use their merchandise without wearing the blood of the workers in the process. The lives of workers in third world countries are taken for granted and exploited. Not only are their lives affected but as well as their family––especially their children’s lives, who have yet to form a voice in today’s society. When workers  try to form unions they risk their lives from the factory’s owners. The sad part is, it kind of really isn’t their fault. Not the workers, nor their managers, nor their bosses. The race to the bottom is a response as developed countries search for the cheapest labor to increase their profits; factories will accept deals offered to them because if they do make business they will shut down and hundreds of jobs will be lost. Huge corporations in developed countries have disregarded human rights for workers producing their products and/or services. Rana Plaza is just one of the best, worst examples of exploitation. After watching this film, I felt guilt as I looked inside my closet, on my desk, on my walls… As consumers we do not think about the implications the production of a pair of jeans will make. Not just on the environment, but of other people’s lives. We never stop and think: ‘Who makes all of this.’ Yes, these stores sell to us, but it goes far beyond that and many are not educated about it. There are 4 seasons in a year and the fact that the fashion industry has 52 is insane. For what? For money. It’s ridiculous that third world countries are paying the true cost for production, meanwhile developed countries and its consumers blindly enjoy what is being sold to them by these corporations. The problem begins with consumers. Consumer culture has honestly been illogical by buying, wearing for a few weeks, and disposing. Thrift shopping is looked down-upon because it is recycled, but does that even matter if at this point it was only worn for a few months? The change starts with consumer culture and their influence on huge corporations to pay a justifiable wage for these production workers in under-developed countries.

I am ashamed of myself. We should be ashamed of ourselves. 

  <br><br>

As I watched the film, I looked at the clothes I was wearing. Leggings from Victoria Secret and a sweater from Gap. Both corporations that outsource the labor of millions of women. That exploit and abuse millions of women. I think about the woman who made the clothes on my body. What she's doing right now. If she's still working at a factory. What her life is like. If she has children. How much of her life she's had to sacrifice, to be making at most, a few dollars a day, just so our clothes can be cheap. We get cheap clothes, corporations get richer by the millions, but somehow, the women who make this transaction possible are screwed over, payed less than five dollars a day to make a t-shirt that'll just end up in a landfill someday. How can we call ourselves progressive when the very clothes on our bodies were made at the expense of basic human rights? What's sad is that most of this is hidden. Most people don't know how their clothing was made, and even if they did, I don't think it would stop them from buying clothes the next time there was a big sale. Not only that, but many of these corporations do not even disclose how their clothes are manufactured. Going ahead, please think about what went into making your clothes. Hold celebrities accountable for popularizing this lifestyle, and remember the true cost of buying cheap clothes.

This documentary reveals the facts behind clothing and Fast Fashion. It is really ironic that when we are becoming crazy on Black Friday and keeping buying stuff that is “cheap”, people who produce these cloths are suffering from them. They earn just $3 or less per day, but the discounted clothes, or “cheap” clothes, in Fast Fashion brands are $10 each. Isn’t it ironic? At the end of the documentary, Livia Firth said that “the only person who is becoming richer is the owner of Fast Fashion brand”. I feel really upset and angry about this. What we consume does not help the growth of the economy or the development of the world, but it is making the situation worse and inflate the expansion of Fast Fashion, deteriorating the living condition of people in poor countries and adding stress and burden to them. People, especially people in developed countries, should really reflect on this issue. As people, especially women, in Cambodia protested for a minimum wage of $160 per month and some of them died and injured, the cruel and serious facts are revealed that the clothes we purchase and wear are made by their blood. In other words, we indirectly harm them and make their living and work conditions hard. It is an issue in regard to poverty, inequality, and human rights, not simply the environment. We should stop the adoration of Fast Fashion and the current consumer culture that happiness comes from the stuff we purchase. We should stop the deterioration of this issue and protect, or just do not harm, these people’s rights and equality.

The first time I watched "The True Cost" I was shocked and devastated. I never realized, or ever thought about, how detrimental fast fashion was to the environment. I am very guilty of buying into fast fashion through companies such as Forever 21, however since watching this film I have tried to limit my purchases are steer away from fast fashion companies. Not only is fast fashion horrible for our environment, but it also encourages inhumane treatment of workers in developing countries. Dangerous buildings, unsanitary working environment, low wages, and abusive bosses are just some conditions these workers have to deal with every day.
  <br><br>

Alternately "The Ugly Cost of Fashion" took a more comedical approach to this situation. While show host Hasan Minhaj basically covered the same information as "The True Cost," I was intrigued by the section of the episode that covered fast-fashion companies efforts to produce "sustainable" pieces. Hasan exposed that these companies are very vague with their efforts and often misleads the public. 
  <br><br>

Overall I believe the companies are to blame for this issue. I think if most of the public had more insight into the conditions in which their clothes are made they would be horrified. When I watched "The True Cost" I completely changed my shopping habits. Now I shop second hand and have dramatically reduced the amount I shop. Additionally, when I do decide to order clothes I turn to brands that are putting effort into being environmentally friendly, such as Patagonia.

I totally agree, prior to watching this film I was completely unaware of the just how toxic the fashion industry was. I too have bought into the fast fashion industry and after having seen this also made efforts to avoid these companies. One of the most eye opening facts however was the fact that the fashion industry cycles through some 52 seasons in a year. This alone is extremely concerning and alarming considering the sheer amount of resources will go into making these clothes but also the amount of clothes that will simply go to waste because they no longer meet the consumer’s desirability. 
   <br><br>
Another issue of great concern in the context of the fashion industry is the blatant disregard for basic rights of workers in this industry. I found it frustrating that many of these factories cut corners and were negligent in their responsibility to provide a safe work environment. Moreover I found it disgusting  when people being interviewed in this documentary tried to rationalize that sweatshops were acceptable. What I find most frustrating however is the fact that the workers are being plainly exploited to the point where they themselves cannot even afford to buy their own clothing and support their own lives. 
  <br><br>
 I also found it interesting when this documentary showed the scenes of people trampling each other to get into stores on black friday. This not only showed the pure absurdness of consumerists obsession with consumption but reflected just how centered our society is around consumption. I also agree with the fact that people choose to solve the issues of life through consumption. This idea of purchasing things to feel better is one of the core issues with our buying habits.
<br><hr>
I was also surprised by this movie. I get used to buying many latest and the most fashionable clothes every year. However, after watching this movie and learning contents from our lectures, I feel really regrettable for my behavior, because I influenced the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere. Although my effect is too small, and there would be only a small change, others would also buy clothes. This will cultivate into a big number and pose greater effect to climate change. What I can do now to protect our environment is control my desire of shopping and advocate my family and friends to do it together.

The film "The True Cost" disgusted me. I can't believe we live in a world where making money is more important than the lives of other people. I can't believe that even when notified by workers that there were cracks in the building no one did anything about it. The fact that even after that incident nothing in the fashion industry changed is horrifying. 
   <br><br>
I almost cried when that mother had to leave her daughter for a year to go work in the factories. If I don't see my mom every 3 to 4 weeks I get really sad. I can't even imagine how hard it would be for young children to do that for an entire year. There need to be more rights implemented for workers in developed countries. They need to have the same rights as workers here. If the same conditions were here in America right now it would be protested and the companies would be boycotted. But because this is happening in another country it isn't seen as a problem for us to deal with even though we are apart of the cause. 
   <br><br>
I was also shocked to hear about the farmers in India committing suicide. Why is no one talking about it?

I agree that it is a big problem how many Americans don’t know or care about the working conditions of people in other countries.  It’s almost as if, because they are not in America, many don’t even see them as humans.  They forget and ignore that each of those people have their own lives and families, and instead only pay attention to the prices of the clothes.  Workers in other countries definitely need at least the same level of working conditions as those in the US. However, if one country raises working conditions, then the cost of production would go up.  Greedy corporations would then move their production to cheaper countries.  Unless the world works together as a whole, it will be difficult to improve these workers' conditions.


<br><hr>
I totally agree with you. The fact that those poor countries have to suffer from greenhouse gas emission although they only contribute tiny portion of it makes me feel sad. Even worse, their working conditions are getting more and more dangerous due to market driven by competition. In some ways, they have to risk their lives and families to earn the money that an American pays for a bottle of water. We’ re all human beings and I think we all deserve the same happiness of life. To make this happen, let’s take action.

I like how this documentary showed raw uncensored footage from news sources. Even though I lost my appetite watching people (dead or slightly alive) getting pulled out of a collapsed building, the documentary effectively utilized pathos to emphasize the lack of humanity in one of the economically biggest industries in the world. The use of uncensored footage was very effective in creating a very aware and alarmist tone. It felt like the documentary movie version of the David Wallace-Wells piece, except with the emphasis on the fashion industry. After watching the documentary, I couldn’t help but feel extremely guilty about all the recent purchases I made online because Forever 21 was having a 40% off sale or H&M was having a huge clearance sale. Those outlets were one of my favorite places to go shopping but I feel like if I walked into an H&M right now, I would see the faces of those who perished in Bangladesh in the factory building collapse. The poorest people in third world countries are being manipulated by the fashion industry without choice; I found the interview with the woman who stated that these workers have no other options in terms of labor or earning money very very interesting because I was constantly thinking, “Why can’t they just quit and find other jobs?” These people don’t have options and they’re the only source of income that comes with an immense amount of risk and sacrifice. CHILDREN, those who work or don’t, are also affected by this issue and the consequences of the chemicals excreted from the factories are causing them to form mental and physical disabilities from a young age. The part where the translator said that the mother was waiting for her disabled son to die hurt my soul; a mother should never be able to say those words in my opinion. At this point, I’m ranting about how everything sucks especially in America, a first world country that contributes the most greenhouse emissions and an economically greedy country.

After viewing Andre Morgan’s “The True Cost,” the director masterfully examines the deceptive tactics of big brand corporations that utilizes to market and appeal to the public. In particular, Morgan explores the fashion industry and how its sways society’s detrimental shopping habits. This, in turn, results in an accumulation of clothes that aren’t being result and increases the amount of waste being produced. What the film does advertise is the recycling of clothes, which is significantly more environmentally friendly than what corporations and consumers are currently doing.
   <br><br>

In my own experience, I have fallen victim to ever-changing fashion trends and have bought an unnecessary amount of clothes for me to only wear them a few times. This film and this class have really provided me with some essential insight on toxic consumerism and how negative it is for the planet. Hopefully, I can avoid being part of the problem and start becoming the solution.

I have to also admit that I am another victim of buying an extremely unnecessary amount of clothes, and especially shoes, mainly to follow society's fashion trends. I have had many guilty cases where I will literally buy entirely new outfits for different occasions just because I didn't want to be seen in the same outfit. After watching this film I have realized the true damage caused by this "toxic consumerism" that you mentioned, for which I have contributed to for many years. This film revealed the truths behind the fashion industry, which many people choose to ignore or really have no idea about. Our consumer culture has become so corrupt and has gotten completely out of hand, and its up to us to put it into check. As much as I love my shoes, I have realized that the collection of them is definitely not a necessity, even less a priority. Hopefully this film has brought others to similar realizations as well.
<br><hr>
I too have fallen victim to fashion trends and buying things that I didn't need. When I was younger I didn't really know of all the ways we as a society pollute. I though that not littering and saving water around the house were the best ways to save the environment and made me a very environmentally conscious person. As I grew older I began to understand how everything has a carbon footprint and changing your life in even the smallest of ways can make a difference. After watching "The True Cost" movie my eyes have been opened to the horrendous truths about our society. It really stuck a chord in my heart when I learned about the sweatshops where people work in very poor conditions and are paid close to nothing. We as Americans have a job to at least try to help those people in need at to care about the people we do business with. It is also incredible how the fashion industry has become so wasteful creating 52 seasons just for a portion of the clothes to go to waste.

<br><hr>
I'm in the same boat as you! Buying shoes is an absolute addiction of mine. Have you seen those limited edition Nike Air Force 1's?! But, just like you, I've learned and decided to prioritize the planet over some silly shoes that I don't need. Hopefully, other people in our class begin to live more modest lives!
<br><hr>
I completely agree! These fashion industries are absolutely obsessed with pumping out an obscene amount of clothes, and at the expense of the planet. We definitely need to put a stop to them. Not only that, but we should  collectively start considering our own carbon footprint as well. Others should follow in your footsteps and begin saving water and not littering. Little things like this add up, benefiting everyone.
<br><hr>
Oh noooo, which ones because theres been several new styles they've revealed... you know what don't tell me because I really don't need any shoe temptations knowing I really don't need new ones as I'm literally looking down at the 1's I have on lol. On a side note though, have you seen the new off-white ones?? Now on a serious note, your'e right I hope people really do open their eyes to step away from these materialistic nonessential items instead of being reeled in.

The short film, “The Ugly Cost of Fashion” was a very eye opening film that discusses the environmental damages that fast fusion entails. The speaker of the film was very engaging, and his tone made his arguments engaging to the audience. The fashion industry replicates "dupes" for expensive designer brands to cater to the middle class, making them very appealing and affordable. Brands such as H&M and ZARA are dominating the industry, and the CEO Of ZARA is the 7th richest man on earth. I find it shocking how fast companies are able to produce clothing. When there is a trending fashion piece on social media or from a celebrity, these companies are able to create the clothes in a matter of days. 
   <br><br>

Companies are able to do this by exploiting workers in third world countries. The factories that manufacture the clothes provide poor working conditions for workers and people are paid less that $3 a day. This is completely unfair and an act against humanity. The people that work at these companies are desperate for any type of work, and are easily exploited. 
   <br><br>

I also find it shocking that the "recycled" clothing items we see in stores are not recycled. In fact, only the name tag is. This is false advertising and people are being taken advantage of. People should have the right to be accurately informed about the choices they make, and fashion companies manipulate the emotions of consumers in order to make profit. 
   <br><br>

Fast fashion must end, causing dilemmas such as endangering the lives of workers, the increase in landfill waste, and using resources that contribute to climate change.

I agree with you that companies are making false advertisements to consumers in order to make a profit. The clothes that we “recycle” aren’t even really being recycled. Watching “The True Cost” made me realize a lot about the fashion industry and the choices I make when shopping. I am that type of person to buy a piece of clothing and only wear it once for a couple of hours, or just mindlessly but clothing items that I know I can’t get much use out of. It’s a bad habit I have and one that has influenced me by consumer culture.
    <br><br>
The most disheartening part of the documentary was the workers that make the clothes for about $3 a day. I actually cried watching the scene when the building collapsed. They work so hard and in terrible working conditions, just so I can wear a $10 t-shirt. These workers don’t get the rights they’re entitled to and are exploited. It’s absolutely heartbreaking.
   <br><br>
 Another aspect of this movie that caught my interest, is that most of the clothes that we donate or that are sold in thrift stores, most likely won’t be bought. We think we are doing a service to the planet when we donate all our unwanted clothes, but most  of the time they still end up in landfills. The fast fashion industry that has been created by the 52 seasons we have a year is absurd. The consumer culture that has been placed upon our generation is harming our planet.


<br><hr>
Exactly, Fast fashion should not continue. Based upon the facts I know, H&M sucks. H&M burns average more than seven million pieces of unsold clothes each season. This is a huge waste of natural resources, and they never consider to donate those clothes to poor people who need it. I understand why they do not donate those:  once they donate once, everyone will wait to get free clothes at the end of each season; but there is no way I can agree with them to do such anti-human things. I mean there are many approaches for them to deal with those unsold clothes rather than just burning it. And I can see no good with the rise of fast fashion: No economic benefits, no environmental benefits, and its styles are normally copied from other brands. FF brands suck and are very anti-human; they should be stopped immediately.

<br><hr>
This film does warn me that we need to think before we make a purchase. I remember the iclickr poll Ken made last week: have you ever done online shopping in the lectures? I expected there were people browsing shopping websites but I did not expected that many. There were about a half percent had done online shopping just during the English 23 lectures. It is obviously that online shopping is now a very important part in our daily life, which means that we have more ways to make purchases. And as a consequence, there are more consumptions than ever. And I agree with you that I found it very ironic that Zara and H&M are claiming that their clothing are environmental friendly and they encourages consumers to donate the clothing they do not want to recycle. However, if they do not over produce clothing, and consumers buy what they need, how come we need to recycle so many clothing? It is a paradox between saving our planet and producing clothes.
<br><hr>
Fast fashion truly must end. It's has a multitude of horrible impacts leading from creation to consuming, only benefiting the seller. There's severe issues revolving around the patented cotton seed and its company, the working conditions, what is basically slavery given that strikes result in violence and death, the detrimental impact on the environment, the greenhouse emissions just from shipping the items, and finally the consumer wasting more of their money binge buying these items to be worn maybe once and then end up in a landfill. Nothing good comes from this yet somehow this fact is so expertly concealed by these companies. It's criminal. Those 1000 lives lost in the collapse of factory building in Dhaka in 2013 MATTER. They were forced into those conditions by rich people who didn't want to take a tiny dent out of their vast amounts of money to have proper safety standards and regulations. It's disgusting and that alone should be enough to get any consumer to stop supporting such a company but consumers just don't seem to know or care. Fast fashion is one of the most disgusting and wasteful parts of our society.

The justification for why workers should take the horrible conditions in the sweat shops is so selfish of Americans to say. I can’t believe that people justify it by saying that at least they have a job, or that they could have worst jobs and that that is considered a good job in their countries. It’s sad how detached Americans are to other human lives. If the same things were happening to their families, there would outcry (as there should be) because safe working conditions are a fundamental right. It really broke my heart (that I even had to pause the video) when I saw how devalued the lives of workers in Bangladesh were. They complained to management that they did not feel safe in the building they were working in, which ended up collapsing and taking about 1,000 Bangladesh workers’ lives. The lady who grows organic cotton made an important point, people don’t think about the clothing they wear the same way people think about the food they eat. People need to further think about the implications that their actions have on the plant and others. If we really thought things through and were conscious of our impact our consumerism has on other humans and the environment, I think that most people would make changes to their behavior. I was surprised to find out that the fashion industry is the number two polluter on Earth, and oil is the first. The disconnect between Americans/ Europeans from the rest of the world is really upsetting. How can we allow for people of other countries to live with such low wages that they can’t even see their children. Is all of this really worth the low cost of fashion, if people’s lives are being put at risk just to meet the standard of production at a low cost. Companies should raise their prices so that workers are paid for the labor they put in, and this would in turn make people buy less due to the rise in cost. But to answer your question, I do think that people are able to make their own choices about what they purchase and if they really cared, they would do their own research. However, companies are to blame for this level of consumption because they put out ads that we take in without any thought and make it seem like we need these items to truly be happy.

After watching the "True Cost," it has made me rethink things about the whole fashion industry and third world countries. I knew that factory workers in third world countries were treated poorly but seeing it in the film just made my heart break. I feel guilty and so ashamed of ever purchasing clothes from fast-fashion brands such as Forever 21, and H&M. This film taught me that there's this whole other world that I didn't even know about. 
   <br><br>


I felt so upset whilst watching this film and watching the mother give up her daughter, Nadia, in order to give her a better life because keeping her in the factory would be unsafe. I felt so angry hearing the women talk about getting beat with sticks, scissors and more because they just wanted a livable wage. I felt such sorrow for the Cambodian workers who lost their lives just wanting better working conditions. We consume and we waste so much here in America. We fell into the trap of extreme consumption and as Ken said, it's due to companies who advertise things to people so early in their life - that's all that they know. 
   <br><br>


A lot of people don't realize the backstory of the clothes we wear. One of the factory workers mentioned that she doesn't want people to wear clothes knowing that it was made out of their blood. I felt that this was such a powerful statement because their backstories are hidden with piles of money pocketed by big owners and companies. This film has encouraged me to stop consuming so much and to start only buying things when needed, not wants.

I felt similarly to the way you did while watching this documentary, watching the women exploited for their cheap labor while their communities are destroyed and have to endure severe environmental impacts. It is crazy to think that ⅙ women in the world work in the global fashion industry, and this documentary shows us that a majority are these third world women being taken advantage of. It was devastating to hear about the factory owners using violence against the women who were just asking for a livable wage. They are so desperate to keep the retail companies from taking their business elsewhere they would rather expose their people to such dehumanizing treatment. 
   <br><br>
I found it infuriating to hear these company representatives try to defend the sweatshops even going as far as claiming they are good for the women. During the interviews, the ginger man tried to argue that, “they’re [ third world women] part of the process that raises living standards and leads to higher wages and better living conditions over time”. How twisted do you have to be to see the unethical treatment of women and defend it claiming they are just a stepping stone to a better situation. They disregard the environmental conditions and the lives of these women and make it seem like they have a choice of working there. I agree with you, the factory women's statement resonated with me because we indeed need to think about where our things come from and make better choices with our dollars.

In response to "The Ugly Cost of Fashion" and Ken's youtube video, I don't know if there is a best way to stop the onslaught of consumerism. The only solution that I see is change at the individual level. If enough people change on their own accord and not due to mandates by the government, then we will start to see some change in how the industry works. The concept of minimalism has to spread like a virus if we are ever going to see any incremental/global change in the way we perceive our conception of consumerism. 
   <br><br>

The idea that Ken proposes in another video, "Inter-generational communication", is an idea that we need to grab ahold of and spread as fast as possible. We need to change ourselves before we have any chance at changing others. This is a communal ideology that needs to be adopted. Once there is enough change to warrant political action, then we still start to see rollbacks on the production of goods and objects with planned obsolescence.
   <br><br>

 I'm always a bit skeptical of when a new concept arises in these videos because I think of how futile the intent is when people are so resistant to change. I can sit here and write "what we need" all day long, but in the end is there any chance that something like this will work globally? I would like to think so, but I have very little hope for the actions of human beings.

I agree with your statement - I also believe that the only solution that I see is change at the individual level. If we first start off with individuals lowering their own environmental impact, that can grow into a large population eventually all working together to reduce their carbon footprint. As Ken constantly reminds us, we need to start this change right now.  We can't just keep saying that we need to start focusing on the environment - we need to actually work towards it, and that starts at the individual level. This follows the concept that you mentioned of inter-generational communication. We can be the people who start helping the environment first, and our actions can influence others to do the same, and the minimalist lifestyle can exponentially spread to so many other people. This can lead to political changes and mandates that require large corporations to reduce their carbon gas emissions, which can be extremely impactful. Overall, I hope that we can all not only influence others to create change but also make change happen ourselves.

“The average American buys 68 new pieces of clothing a year [emphasis added]”. Ok but why? If you asked me how much new clothing the average American buys per year, I would say maybe… 20, or 30, which already seems enormous to me. There is something a little decadent about that 68 number. Hasan Minhaj jokes about the ability of being a “discount version of Cardi B”. First off, I don’t think any rational person would want to associate themselves with such a revolting individual as Mrs. Cardi B. But secondly, is truly a sign of decadence of our way of life that anyone would even want to do that. And this isn’t even considering the environmental issue. That’s another monster to kill. What an abhorrent situation folks.

I think it's easy to overlook how much we are buying in the grand scheme of things until it all adds up and is sitting in front of us. I know I personally love to shop online once every couple months, and then usually if I end up going downtown on the weekends I'll buy a couple things, and if I need something specific for an event or a trip, not to include the small things I buy here and there. It all adds up and I know I don't actually need all of it but it's difficult to conceptualize when its over a period of time such as a year. I am at fault for doing this because I fail to realize where the clothes I'm buying are actually being sourced from. Upon watching this film, I have learned that all of it is fast fashion, clothes that are produced by oppressed workers in underdeveloped countries. Hearing the brutal conditions of the workers in the factories and the abuses they are subjected to was heart breaking and made me realize what I am contributing to. It's people's livelihoods that are being affected by our spending habits, something that really puts one's actions into perspective. This issue is intrinsically linked to the worsening condition of the planet, since the buying and throwing away takes place in a cyclical fashion, letting the cycle of textiles being produced in immoral ways only to be thrown away as waste.


<br><hr>
I think that average also fails to take into account a lot of outliers and is maybe not a great face value number for actually average americans. I wonder, for instance, how many of those pieces were socks, in comparison to a dress. I also wonder how many of those pieces were fast fashion or thrifted. Is the average actually 68, or does that number get bumped up heavily by the greed of people who buy hundreds of clothing items. I understand the point that is trying to be made, but I think a more in depth analysis of that data would be helpful in understanding where all the waste comes from.
<br><hr>
I can't even imagine buying 68 new pieces of clothing each year. Not including the essentials such as socks and such, I maybe buy 5-10 pieces of new, unworn clothes maximum. Maybe it's because I hate the ordeal of shopping, but I simply can't see the need to buy this many pieces of clothing per year. At that point, how many clothing items are actually getting worn vs. stored in a closet 365 days a year? On another note, which average Americans are they interviewing? I still can't fathom the idea of the number (avoiding saying 68 to sound like a broken record) of clothes listed in this statistic.

<br><hr>
I don't enjoy shopping much and as such don't often buy clothes often, but I certainly end up with 20 items of clothing in a year. With the cheap accessibility of clothing here, it is extremely easy to amass clothing without even noticing it. Looking back just this school year at UCSB, here is a breakdown of my clothing: I got 4 free cheaply made UCSB shirts from different freshman events, two running shorts from the well and fitness festival, 4 shirts and a hoodie for Christmas, 2 sweaters from my aunt,  a hoodie as a late birthday gift, and a pair of jeans from my parents. This is just an example of how I ended up with 14 clothing items in a few months without paying for any. To be fair, the sweaters, 2 of the shirts and the pair of jeans are actually responsibly sourced and will more than likely last me a few years, but the majority of the items will probably not last me the year. 
   <br><br>


I am not justifying this behavior, I am simply offering an explanation at how this number arises. It doesn't take a shopaholic or even a hoarder, simply living within our society is enough to drown in clothing. This is a major societal problem that is going to take a major societal push in the right direction to fix.



<br><hr>

Like you just mentioned "The average American buys 68 new pieces of clothing a year" is by far the most mind-blowing fact I have learned this year. How destructive can we be to think that this is in any way rational? How greedy are we as a society that we must have a new outfit every single time, or we feel as if we are too "bummy" or out of style? There are no longer just four seasons in the fashion industry and all of this is to convince people that a new style is out. This is obviously just fake consumerism jibberish to get people to spend, spend, spend! But we have to stop now, as soon as possible. We have to recycle clothes and stop buying a new outfit each month; otherwise, we will regret it deeply.

The film "The True Cost" showcased just how disgusting our consumer culture is. I've always known that the majority of our clothes and items are imported from other countries, but I had no idea that it was as much as 97%. I also had no idea of just how little these people are getting paid and how awful their work conditions are. The fact that myself and probably a lot of other people didn't know the extent of this mistreatment is unbelievable. Seeing the footage from the Rana Plaza disaster put everything into perspective to me. If anything of that scale -- with over 1000 deaths -- happened in the US, everybody would know about it. Because it's in Bangladesh, halfway across the world, I have never even heard of it. It felt like I was lied to by the news and corporations.
<br><br>
Another part of the film that set me over the edge was when the news tried to JUSTIFY the working conditions of these sweatshops. They tried to say that these garment factories are way better conditions than anywhere else people could work at. Either way, it is still incredibly immoral to put people under these conditions, just so we can live with a higher standard of living in the US. Everything is about profit and owning the newest thing. We only care about the monetary cost of our items, not the cost it has on the millions of people around the world that do our dirty work. We don't care to think about the cost it has on their health. We don't care about how it separates families and forces parents into a cycle of cheap labor. We don't care because if we did, then we wouldn't have the cheap, accessible goods that we have today. It's disgusting, to say the very least.

I agree with watch you said. It's sad to see how unfortunate the workers in India has to deal with bad working conditions and abuse from managers and bosses. It's sad that I was not aware this was happening and that our consuming habits, contributes, supports this even more. It's heartbreaking to see one of the person interviewed said " They could have been doing something worse." The factories does provide jobs, but they need to give more opportunities, provide better wages for those workers. Yes, cheap labor benefits the economy, but what about moral values, helping the workers from less developed countries. To those corporations and companies: don't wait until you make a lot of money to donate to charity, act now and give better wages for workers in India, manufacturing workers in other countries.

"The Ugly Cost of Fashion" left me in shock. I grow every day more and more infuriated with this consumer world. It sucks because we grew up in it and it's not until now that we realize the true cost of our habits to consume and consume and consume. I feel extremely taken advantage of by these corruptions for using language against us. They understand how ignorant we really are and feed off of it. Learning about greenwashing is a huge eyeopener. I cannot help but feel this intensity of emotions towards Zara and H&M now. I genuinely do not want to shop at ANY fast fashion location again. And I am vowing to it right now. I will only do so if the occasion is really called for but thrifting is definitely the way I want to go now for clothing. It saves me money, the planet, and from being exploited by these companies. I want to completely stop buying clothes from these sites online. The internet has made consuming so much easier and faster. If shopping was only done in the physical world, I think consumerism would go down even a bit.
 <br><br>
 It's frustrating to think about how this is all becoming known to me because of the college setting I am in. I wish these videos were popular. I wish I could ask someone, "oh have you seen the Ugly Cost of Fashion" and have everyone I ask say "oh yeah, it appeared on---." I just think it sucks how these types of films are not circulating in popular culture because they really do make you want to stop being such an awful consumer. 
 <br><br>
It's crazy to think about all those pieces of clothing I would buy on the internet when I first started college. I didn't know the harm was THIS great. To think of fast fashion as having 52 seasons a year is even wilder. It makes me genuinely feel disgusted by our culture and our complete disregard for this planet and others. The fact that manufacturing clothing ALONE can take 24 years of drinking water for only one person is maddening. This climate crisis we keep expanding is maddening.

How crazy is it to think that instead of having 2 seasons, one for the winter and one for the summer, we literally rotate through a different season EVERY WEEK!! I love the fact that you are vowing to never shop at any fast-fashion brand and only to thrift from now on, and I think I am going to join you on your venture. Knowing that the average American throws away 80lbs of clothes a year and that only 10% of our donated clothes actually end up in thrift stores is depressing. What we've been made to believe is a good thing, has turned out to be just the antithesis of that. One thing that really struck me was that if everyone bought one used item, instead of a new item, we would save 6 pounds of CO2 emissions, which is equivalent to removing half a million cars off the road for a year. 
 <br><br>

It's crazy to think that in 2015, textile production created more greenhouse gas emissions than from international flights and maritime shipping combined! And seeing as Ken warned us that flying is the absolute worst thing you can do for the planet, that idea is absolutely mindblowing to me.


<br><hr>
My perspective on this ongoing issue is very similar to yours in the sense that I feel like I have unknowingly and unwittingly been controlled by huge corporations as well. I myself am also guilty for purchasing products produced by fast fashion industries. Little did I know that their "green" initiatives are largely ineffective and still contribute to textile pollution just as much as they did beforehand. The fact that such industries would entice us into purchasing more products by offering discounts for "recycling" clothing makes me feel great resentment towards them. We're merely just pawns in their game of chess. 
 <br><br>

Like you, I wish I had been informed of all of this before entering college. If I had known just how much oil and water are used to produce certain types of material, I wouldn't have impulsively bought so many articles of clothing in the previous years. It's crazy to think that polyester, nylon, and spandex products use 342 million barrels of oil per year and that it takes 10, 330 gallons of water (the equivalent of 24 years of drinking water for one person) to grow cotton, all of which will eventually and inevitably end up in landfill once again. To think that we as a nation went from  purchasing an average of 12 articles of clothing per year in the 1980s to 68 today is sickening. It seems that we are only consuming faster and faster every year and that there is no end in sight. Hopefully we all come to our senses and soon realize that these corporations only care about making money and couldn't care less about the mess they are leaving behind.
<br><hr>


 I was also shocked by the deceptive practices utilized by fashion companies to fake being environmentally friendly. By using terms like “eco-friendly” and “sustainability” they are tricking the public into thinking they are contributing to the solution when in reality they are contributing far more to the problem. The fact that in 2015, textile production produced more greenhouse gases than international flights and maritime shipping combined just showcases how bad the fashion industries have been to the earth. 
 <br><br>
I was also surprised by the statistics provided about “fast-fashion” companies like Zara and Fashion Nova. Not just about the amount of clothing produced or stores owned but also by their “quick-response manufacturing” business practices. Not only is this business practice contributing massive amounts of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere but it also sets a dangerous trend for the future of fashion. By producing large amounts of clothes and then only producing more of the trends that sell, they are leaving massive amounts of clothes to be wasted. Additionally, I find this business practice to almost be dishonest, they are essentially stealing the designs of larger name-brand companies and selling them as their own with minor changes. 
 <br><br>
Overall, I agree with your frustrations with the consumerist culture of modern-day American society. It is very frustrating that the majority of our generation is unaware of the environmentally harmful effects of their shopping habits. While some are probably aware of the impact that the fashion industry has on our planet, most have no idea how environmentally disastrous this industry is. I do agree that these types of films need to be more widely circulated so that people become more aware of the issue.

I too was shocked with environment of the shops that run our clothes that we don't even think about. The living conditions that people live in was abysmal and inhumane. Humanities natural order is to enrich corporations. When professor Hiltner talked about how a commercial was used to sell a brand and enforcing what it meant to be a woman. Using cosmetics and clothes and being beautiful is what it means to be a woman. Their goal was to create consumers and it was a very evil and immoral field. By consistently hinting this it creates the next generation of consumers who aim to be beautiful. This is quite evident in today's society as its so common for today's generation of girls in which consumerism is higher for woman then for men. I also had no idea how much the clothing industry had on the environment and the disastrous effects they have on the environment for throwing away hundreds of thousands of pieces of perfectly usable clothing simply because it isn't in fashion and to prevent them from losing money. people mock the past fashions but still follow the current and most popular things .


<br><hr>
Your comment really struck me because I didn't think about the fact that some people will never have the chance to know that this video exist, much less the important information that it holds. I think here at UCSB, we are very privileged to have a class that teaches about the negativities and consequences of consumer culture. I would say that most people in America are probably unaware of how bad fast fashion corporations really are. I do wish that films such as this would go viral so that a wider audience of people could have access to it. We need to find a way to hold these fast fashion corporations accountable for the way they take advantage of consumers in America and workers in other countries. 
 <br><br>

I do agree with you that thrifting is the better option. Last year, I began to thrift most of the clothes that I bought. Thrifting is really great because it is fun to hunt down the clothes that you like instead of simply having them handed to you by fast fashion brands. And of course, the environmental benefits are enormous. Reusing and recycling clothes is something we should all strive to do. Additionally, I donated or resold the clothes I no longer wanted anymore instead of throwing them out since they were still in good condition. I believe that thrifting is a great trend and should be encouraged. I hope that eventually, because of thrifting, our American culture may begin to focus less on what is "in season" or the new fashion. We do not need to keep up with whatever "trends" that fast fashion brands come up with.

<br><hr>
I’ve long been a fan of Patriot Act, but hadn’t yet watched the “The Ugly Cost of Fast Fashion”. The idea that we have dozens of “seasons” within fast fashion as opposed to two or three within “regular” fashion is astonishing – his example, where he points out that a fast fashion brand knocked off an article of clothing Kim Kardashion wore less than 24 hours after she was first spotted in public with it truly made me realize how “fast” fashion really has become. As you point out, it feels as though us as consumers are being exploited – I used to shop at H&M a lot when I was younger, and even still visit the nearby location. But I didn’t realize until I watched this video how bad shopping at fast fashion brands are for the environment. We are only making our world worse.

<br><hr>
I was also stunned by the truth that was presented in these documentaries. You're right about the fact that culturally, consumerism is something that is ingrained in our systems, something that's unquestionably necessary in our lives if we can afford it. Humans are creatures of habit and we seldom think about all of the negative externalities that result from our actions. We see a store, we go window shopping, we make impulsive purchases. The positive feedback loop that results from buying the next season of clothing creates this vicious cycle of consumption. Meanwhile, people in developing countries such as Bangladesh are exploited for their labor and we are lied to about the ethics of these companies. 
 <br><br>
I agree that the ignorance of the general population is frustrating. As a society, most of us have smartphones that provide access to a wealth of knowledge. Instead of harnessing that power and those resources, we idly sit by, scrolling through social media mindlessly while the rest of the world goes on around us. If we were to take notice and do our research, imagine how well informed we would all be. I too wish that these documentaries were common knowledge for their own sake as well as a topic of interest outside of Tik Tok videos and memes. Furthermore, the proliferation of technology within our society has enabled companies to advance consumerist agendas through convenience. This goes hand in hand with social media, which has become a platform for displaying and endorsing consumerist lifestyles and brands. 
 <br><br>
Ultimately, I too plan on buying second hand clothing as an alternative to fast fashion brands. By thrifting, we become more environmentally friendly. By changing the cultural habits of our generation, we can start making a difference.

As "The True Cost" discussed the sheer amount of waste created by the companies, it became clear that American consumer culture has become a cycle of laying waste on the resources and sustainable human conditions of countries other than our own. However, we seem to be doing bad on our own anyways. We have just learned to spill that waste onto other countries’ environments. Moreover, I felt guilt and a sense of irresponsibility for being somewhat aware about the whole issue surrounding factory production and sweatshops, yet continuing to purchase some of my clothes from the very places that carry out the injustice. For example, I am probably going to stop shopping at Uniqlo. It has dawned on me that convenience and cheapness may not be something to be looking for in clothing. Such things have been so easily manipulated by the fast-fashion industry. As a result, I felt a sense of pessimism towards that industry’s ability to carry out any change or reparation for the destroyed families and environments they have left in their trail towards maximum profit. This pessimism was especially fueled by the comments made by the Fox News interview in the film and the excuses made by Benjamin Powell and Kate Ball Young. 
 <br><br>
The film effectively communicates the vastness and urgency of the issue of clothing and textile manufacturing in third world countries. The documentary does so because it manages to look at each level of the injustices; whether it be the consumer level, the perspective of the sweatshop worker, the executive carrying out the injustice, and the ways in which some clothing lines are taking action or responding. We get every perspective as well as an understanding as to why the perspective is carried. For example, we see that the executives of clothing manufacturers merely see the poor conditions and low wages as the only option for the people living in that third world country. However, as the documentary goes on, I began to truly understand that such an excuse is inherently selfish, profit-based, and just purely lazy. The people at the top of these fast-fashion giants seem to believe that they are doing a favor. On the contrary, it's clear that their actions and desire for little involuntary regulation are exploitative.

"The True Cost" was very difficult for me to watch. The devastating events that occurred in Rana Plaza were, for me, a major focal point of the film. The thousands of women that lost their lives there served as a mere symbol of the true catastrophe that happens in places like Cambodia and Bangladesh every day. As I was watching the horror unfold, i couldnt stop thinking: and for what? What do we as a whole humanity have to gain from this horrific scene. The answer for humanity as a whole was nothing, we have nothing to gain from this. Individuals and corporations, however, are being made rich and powerful from the gross mistreatment of others. To me this provides an answer to the question of who is responsible. It is clear that those who receive the most direct benefit from this abomination of business must then also be those who are responsible. I also found it extremely aggravating that they flipped their obvious position as an abuser to one of a benefactor. They do this by changing the narrative from one that describes taking advantage of the desperation of the poor to providing jobs where there are otherwise none. The truth about consumerism is that, through a historical lens, one can clearly see that we are conditioned to want the things that are manufactured for our consumption, not the other way around. Kens anecdote is a perfect example of said conditioning, and, reading through the comments, it is easy to see it is not the only account out there.

I completely agree with you on the fact that this was very difficult to watch. All of the events shown in the film show the devastating extremes that corporations will go to just have their product be the cheapest and most successful on the market. It hurts to see that these companies are abusing their power to gain dirt-cheap labor at the cost of these factory workers’ lives. I can’t imagine going to work every day and knowing about all of the different ways I can get hurt or potentially killed on the job. No $3 shirt is worth the life of a human, EVER!
<br><br> 
The workers have no choice but to keep working at these factories to live and take care of their families. This documentary revealed fast fashion brands’ gross abuse of power over the poor and uneducated. Hopefully, this documentary has inspired many people to stop and think about where their clothes are coming from, and at what cost was their $5 t-shirt manufactured. I am hopeful for the future, for our generation is becoming more and more aware of these global injustices. I believe our generation can really put an end to the fast fashion industry by just stopping and thinking about how an article of clothing that they are going to buy got to their hands, and at what cost.


<br><hr>
While I agree with almost everything you said, I have to disagree with you on one thing. You asked the question, who is responsible? with the obvious answer that the businesses are. But I have to disagree. I think that we consumers are the ones that are responsible, the governments are responsible, and of course, the businesses are responsible as well. It is easy to place the blame on the major corporations that are in hindsight the number 1 benefactors from these individuals, but we cannot remove ourselves out of the equation. I know I am guilty of always looking for the item with the cheapest price, who wouldn't love a t-shirt from H&M for $%?! The workers in Bangladesh and Cambodia that's who. When we start placing the blame on ourselves rather than removing ourselves from the situation holistically, it might instill a deeper desire to take action ourselves, rather than waiting for the big corporations, who will always be driven by profit, to take action. 
<br><br> 

Watching the Rana Plaza disaster, I felt more than heart-broken, I felt defeated. I was not only left with a feeling of anger towards the corporations but a grave feeling of guilt and regret, knowing that it is highly likely that I have many items in my closet that I enjoy wearing, that are made with the blood and sweat of these workers. The Fashion industry is a $3 trillion annual industry, yet the workers are earning $2 a day!!? And the fact that Low wages, unsafe conditions, and factory disasters are all excused because of the needed jobs they create for people with no better alternative, or because "all they're doing is sewing clothes", "they could be working in much worse conditions." In the 1960s the US was still making 95% of their clothes, today only 3% is made in the US. Have you ever sat and asked yourself why? It's not only because of cheaper labor, but it's also because they know that in a country with proper human rights, labor unions, and government regulations, they would never be able to treat the workers like they do in these third world countries. 
<br><br> 

Apart from the garment workers, our inherent overconsumption of goods has impacted the environment in a disastrous manner,  the overuse of GMOs and fertilizers to control pests and increase the yield of crops such as cotton have resulted in not only inorganic and possibly harmful products but also in people around the farms suffering from diseases and sicknesses, for example, in Punjab, the largest user of pesticides, 60 mentally ill kids were found in one village. Apart from that, the constant demand for cotton has resulted in more than 250,000 recorded farmer suicides in India alone. The businesses and producers take advantage of these farmers and workers because of their inherent need for work and to provide for their families. I tear up thinking about how in the face of profit and success, humans have lost all semblance of their humanity. We need someone to really hold up a mirror to everyone involved at this point and show them the "True Cost" of their actions.

Hearing that 97% of our clothes are made from people living in Third World countries was really shocking to me. I knew that the percentage was going to be high but I didn't think it would be THAT much. When the first scene of the factory collapsing was shown, I felt upset and extremely bad for everyone that had to go through that experience and especially, those who lost their loved ones during the incident. 931 lives could have been saved if the factory owners would have warned their workers about the evacuation and let them go. And the fact that there's people in the US that don't see any problem with workshop workers and how their bosses treat them. When I heard the woman say she made a list of demands, with other workers from the same factory, to present to her boss I was happy to hear them finally speaking up for themselves. Then, to hear her say that in response to their demands, their boss physically abused them.. that broke my heart. These women finally got the courage to speak out for themselves, just to be beaten up and yelled at.
<br><br> 
Over time, more GMOs have been added into our crops because they just can't seem to keep up with society's demand for them. Cotton used to make our everyday outfits are sprayed with copious amounts of pesticides and chemicals when growing the crop. With fast fashion being something everyone is guilty of doing, more cotton has to produced. While it isn't true for me personally, the average person buys 60 items of clothing a year. The idea of splurging on an outfit for a one-time event sounds ridiculous yet we're guilty of doing it. Over the years, this way of thinking has been more and more normalized and accepted but we should try to change these ways of thinking for the benefit of our planet

I really enjoyed "The True Cost" because it really visualized the detrimental impacts of materialism like I hadn't seen before. In the other readings, I connected materialism with being bad for the environment but just like the main problem with the climate crisis, we couldn't see the main effects right away. With this movie, there was so much emotion involved because we had stories from the past and present of people who are affected by this materialism. One of the facts that really stood out to me was that about 250,000 Indian farmers committed suicide at the hands of Monsanto. We heard the emotion in the person talking about this statistic, we heard the emotion of the Indian man talking about how there is no care for the lives of the workers. And we saw those workers. 
<br><br> 


I believe that seeing this would drive many people to seriously think about how they are consuming their products and thinking about what they buy. While it may be hard to shift the materialism of the United States in the name of climate change, since it's impacts cannot be seen, if Americans could see corporations' complete lack of human life, I'm sure people would have second thoughts before going to H&M. Another line that stuck out to me in the film is when one of the women said "These companies continuously win win win as nature and people lose lose lose. For example, Monsanto is happy that the Indian farmer's families are getting cancer because they also own the medicine that they will purchase. 
<br><br> 


I really question how these big corporations are doing these sorts of things. The only conclusion that I can come up with is that the heads of these companies aren't seeing all the death and horror that they are causing because they are sat behind a desk looking at numbers and finances. But at the same time, how could they not know with all of these news stories? It angers me because if the heads of these companies know what they are doing and continue to do it in the name of profit, they are the same people that will watch the human race run themselves into the ground as they get richer. I just don't understand it. Hurting the climate by spurrting CO2 or putting plastic in the waters is somehow easier to empathize with than what they are doing here. At least they can't see direct implications, but with the humans here, the deaths and pain are right in front of their eyes.

It is upsetting that so many people do not know about this side of the fashion industry.  Before watching this film, I did know that a lot of fast fashion companies were producing their products through sweat shops, which have horrible working conditions.  However, there is a difference between reading in some articles that sweatshop workers are suffering and actually seeing the lives these workers have to live.  The unfortunate thing is, it is very likely that these companies will ever do anything to try to get better working conditions for these people because the only thing that matters is profit.  
<br><br> 
I was not aware of how little regard Americans had for their clothing.  People will buy things that are trendy at the moment fully knowing that the trend will not last, meaning that when the trend is over, that piece of clothing will be thrown away or tossed in the back of the closet even if it is still functional as clothing.  Furthermore, not everything is bought with the intention of using it until it is no longer functional.  Some things are bought just because they are on sale.  Some things are thrown away just because they have a tear (that could be mended).
<br><br> 
It is especially important for Americans to see films like this so that they can be made aware of how the clothing they throw away so easily is produced.  Knowing that your clothing was made by people who make well under a sustainable wage and in life threatening working conditions will definitely have an impact on how people think about their spending.

I agree with your concerns about the conditions of the workplace and hourly wage of which all this fast fashion is being produced. These workers are being put through horrible working conditions just for us to wear the clothing items a couple of times before we feel they aren't "cool" enough anymore or aren't going to help us feel confident compared to the new fashion/trends that everyone else is already hoping onto. I like how Ken put "the American dream" into perspective. He claims we must change the American dream and what it means but we better change it quickly. I agree. If the American dream implies a lavish and luxurious lifestyle, what good is it if you're just damaging the earth at the end of the day and will be hated by many that have to suffer consequences for your actions? The American dream should rather be about living and promoting a sustainable lifestyle so that we can all enjoy many more inhabitable years on earth rather than making earth uninhabitable from our lousy, selfish, and ultimately stupid idealistic of what it means to live a nice life with nice things.

"They needed to make more than just cosmetics... they had taken up the business of making consumers".  It seems today that companies that sell to the masses hit on many different ways of making the world a worse place.  In this example, Ken talks about how companies and their advertising are driving our unhealthy consumer culture.  There is no appeal to logos or establishing an ethos, the current state of advertising is abusing human pathos.  Companies make us insecure, jealous, and wanting through advertisements and the media.  This is 21st century psychological warfare against the masses.  Our minds our being infected with propaganda to make us want to buy more stuff.

<br><br> 

Another way companies are making the world worse is through environmental destruction.  Based of "The True Cost" we see many examples of actions that destroy the environment such as mass chemical spraying of agricultural fields, the mass waste created by fast fashion,  and human illnesses caused by chemicals needed to make goods.  There is no regard for the Earth when your 4th Quarter earnings are down 2% and you can't lose money for your investors.  This is why it is so important for others with power to take a stand.  BlackRock, and asset management firm with 7.5 trillion under management has stated they will put the environment a the center of their investment plans.   This is a tangible way for one company to help solve the woes of our world.

I completely agree with everything you have said, and therefore everything both Ken mentioned and “The True Cost” addressed.  I remember when I was younger, ads were such a huge part of television.  Unlike today in which providers like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ dominate the television world, I used to have to sit through many advertisements just to watch a twenty minute show.  To this day, they still affect me - I bet everyone from our generation remembers the lines “Credit Karma will always be free.” “Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there!” But it is not just about the ad - it is about the fact that as adults, we remember not only who was advertising, but what they were advertising.  You start feeling like you need something because everyone else has it, which drives the economy a certain way.  The cosmetics example was worse in every aspect though because of the impact it has on a young girl or boy’s sexuality and idea of what women want versus what men want.  For example, most lipstick brands have women wearing pink and sparkles and dancing, meanwhile there are no men expressing themselves the same way (though there are men in the world who embrace it).  This creates the divide and stigmatism through years and years of underlying intentions by companies who are merely greedy, not thinking about the effect it would have on those children as they become adults.
<br><br>
 The true cost made my stomach sick after seeing how workers are treated and the corruption that happens on such a macro level in our country.  It is tough because though it is great to have competition in our capitalistic society, but with the amount of demand for product it has created a lack in other places in the industry.  For example, they spend more money on making more, more, and more, while they allow cheap but detrimental chemicals that degrade our environment.  This film reminded me how I learned in AP Environmental Science about how many companies are actually releasing toxic waste in illegal ways to evade the fee for the correct disposal.  Among this, like you said, fast fashion creates a huge amount of waste.  This all needs to stop, but it has to start from both the consumer and the company levels to create a snowball effect.


<br><hr>
I like the sentence you mentioned that “...they had taken up the business of making consumers”. The film had a clip of many YouTubers sharing their clothes, makeup, and many videos are even supported by brands. Those advertisements covered our eyes, and called our desires of shopping. We are in the cycle of this fast fashion era. Looking back to my times, I even paid for this advertisement. When I am bored, I like to watch YouTube - people who are sharing clothes or makeup cosmetics. Their perfect “establishment” opens my shopping desires, and an order is completed. 
   <br><br>
 Meanwhile, as you said, those companies are making the world worse by destroying the environment. Besides what you said, I also want to mention the transportation between the trade. As the film said, now the US is only doing 3% of their clothes. The remaining 97% of products depend on other countries. Transporting those clothes also will produce a lot of CO2 and will harm the environment.

I fall into deep thought after watching the documentary. In the past nineteen years, I never realize that the fashion industry will have such a huge impact on the environment. Nevertheless, I never think that it is the value of consumption of human beings does more harm to the environment than the process of production itself. 
   <br><br>
In the documentary, the producer mentions some prevalent YouTube videos. The YouTubers are showing how many clothes they buy at a low price. The idea of buying things at a low price is like a virus that is spread to every audience who watch the videos. It seems like we can afford more items than we do before, but in the reality, we can afford them because the fashion industries have lowered their cost so that they can earn profit by selling more quantities. 
   <br><br>
It is exactly the lowered cost that affects things in many perspectives in a bad way. Because of the lowered cost, the operators must use chemicals to increase the yield of the raw materials, and the chemicals not only damage the environment but also do harm to human physical health. Because of the lowered cost, the operators must cut the salary of the workers and simplify the working environment of them, and the poor condition of working not only causes death to the workers but also leads to chaos of parade of the workers. 
   <br><br>
Fortunately, many people in fashion notice this situation and start to do as many things as they can to improve it. They change the planting pattern into organic planting – a more sustainable way of planting. They change the working environment of the workers in fashion industries. However, if we want to affect a permanent cure, we need to change the value of consumption of the people. We need to stop pursuing pleasure from buying things more than necessary just because we want to show off how superior we are. We must return to the age when we buy what we need, and most importantly, be thoughtful to everything and everyone around us and be grateful to the mother nature of giving us such a beautiful place to live.

“The True Cost” is an amazing but heartbroken documentary depicting and evaluating the negative consequences behind the current fast fashion industry. It’s undeniable that the development of fast fashion brings cost-effective products and convenience to consumers with middle-income, but it kept generating detrimental effects that shouldn’t be neglected. Those workers in the origin area of the products are losing their rights to earn salaries that they deserved and their working environment isn’t guaranteed with safety and stability, which is absolutely unethical. The natural environment is also being threatened by the rapid expansion of fast fashion because the planting of GM cotton requires the intense use of pesticides, which leads to serious environmental damage to the land. More terribly, this also leads to the infant’s primary mental and physical deficiencies in the Punjab of India and serves as different inducements for cancer. The disposal of a large amount of abandoned clothes constantly goes into other developing countries like Haiti as landfills, contaminating their land and water and also weakening their productivities. There are no words that can ever describe my feelings for this. Overall, Andrew Morgan did a great job spreading out his perspectives towards the fast fashion business and his concerns too. I don’t think this documentary will change the whole picture in the short term, but definitely be a brand-new beginning for a movement.

  I agree with the fact that "The True Cost" brought to light many of the consequences of fast fashion. Countries such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, India had employees working in factories for less than $3. In the same way, big corporations mistreated their workers with low wages and unsafe working conditions. Since there were no other alternatives, and this is the only way money could be made, workers could not speak up to authority. This is capitalism at work. Additionally, growing crops meant use of more pesticides which causes environmental damage and leads to birth defects and increased rate of cancer. Solutions to this never came to light, and this is a prime example of what is occurring in today’s world. Yet, no one is preventing it from continuing.
  <br><hr>
  Hi I totally agree with your comment! The True Cost really got me thinking about fast fashion and the entire trend of the fashion industry all over again because now I know the horrible truths behind this economic system and how terrible it treated its workers who are the foundation for this system because the entire fashion industry can collapse without the laboring and hard work from the workers to produce those pieces of clothing. I think this film can serve as a wake-up call for a lot of people by revealing the ugly, dirty, filthy aspects behind the glamorous, fashing appearance of fast fashion because the beautiful, cheap pieces of clothing did not come without a price; indeed, they are made at the price of the blood, health, and the very lives of the workers who produced the clothes. We need to be more conscious now whenever we go shopping for clothes because the ugliness shown by this film cannot be forgotten and we need to remind ourselves that the shirt we are holding on our hands right now represents so much more than just a shirt: it represents the blood, sweat, and tears of the workers who made it, it represents the heavy pollution in the workers' local rivers due to the production of millions of shirts like this one; it represents the ubiquitous health concerns and diseases for the local workers as a result from drinking the polluted water; it represents the carelessness and ignorance of the factory owners and the top fashion brands.

I agree that this documentary did a good job of bringing the human cost of fast fashion to light. I already knew that fast fashion was incredibly bad for the environment, but I hadn't realized all of the ethical costs that came with it. I vaguely knew about sweatshops, but seeing all these people working terrible conditions for practically no pay because they have no other choice illustrated just how terrible the fashion industry is. It broke my heart when I heard the story of the mother who could not raise her child because she had to spend all day in the factory. It also made me sad to see how all of these workers have no choice because if they can't meet the outrageous demands of fashion companies, then the companies will move somewhere else. And all that, most of the clothes they produce will be quickly worn and thrown away by Americans, to end up dumped in poor nations or landfills. I already tend to buy clothes sparingly, and only when I feel I need to, but I did still used to donate  old clothes when I felt they did not fit my style anymore. This documentary made me realize how donating clothes is pretty similar to throwing them away, so from now on, even when I feel like I don't like the clothes I have that much I will try to still wear or repurpose them, rather than throwing them away.

The True Cost was a chilling look into what goes into what we wear. Who would’ve thought that clothing, a fundamental aspect of human beings, has a dark side. The relentlessness of consumerism and the need to “do better than last quarter” has driven producers to the breaking point, sometimes literally. The deaths of fabric makers in India was eye opening to me. As Americans, I think we often forget how intertwined our everyday lives are with the world. Every purchase we make is like a ripple effect, yet it’s so easy to dismiss our social responsibility of treating people ethically. The story of the Indian woman with the daughter, I forget her name, was shocking. Her quote: “I don’t want anyone wearing anything, which is produced by our blood” stopped me cold. By the end of this video I wanted to throw out every fast fashion item I own, but then take it all back because it’s alternative destiny is to rot in a landfill. And the grooming of children to associate excessive consumerism as a part of maturing only adds to this chaos. Still, there is hope. This vicious cycle is beginning to be broken up as minimalism and thrift shops become trendy. In my hometown, there are second hand stores where you can sell your old clothes to them. These stores are different from thrift shops because they aim to have more items that are geared towards younger generations. Stores like these are a great example of how we can shift to become more mindful consumers.

Watching The True Cost has opened my eyes to the harsh reality of the fashion world. I never knew that this is what happened in order to make a t-shirt, and frankly, I am horrified at what has been shown in this film. I admit that I have more clothes than I could ever need in my closet, but I had no idea that this is what happened behind the scenes of a clothing factory. Companies that think it is ok to take advantage of people in third-world companies are disgusting. Yes, their presence brings more jobs for the people of those countries, but there is no reason for them to be paid less than three dollars a day. If these companies treated their workers in an ethical way, there would not be this much violence and death surrounding the industry.
   <br><br>

Additionally, it is scary to think about how well clothing companies keep the events that are transpiring at their factories out of the media. I had no idea the amount of people that have literally given their life to this industry. This is also the first time I have heard of the collapsed building in Dhaka and the protests in Cambodia. I cannot think of a single reason for these deaths to have occurred; the clothing industry makes an enormous amount of money every year, so they should be paying workers a fair wage and keeping the working conditions safe. If these companies have enough power to minimize the publicity of events like these, what else have they been hiding?
   <br><br>

Seeing this film is making me think twice about the clothing in my closet. Nobody deserves to be treated this way. Nobody should be shot because they are protesting for fair pay. Nobody should have to die because these companies.

This week’s film, “The True Cost” ties with “Before the Flood” for my favorite and, in my opinion, most captivating film that we have watched in this class thus far. This one definitely was extremely depressing. I felt called out - rightfully so - because I personally am a consumer of fast fashion. Anyone who knows me in real life knows that almost my entire wardrobe comes from H&M, which was featured kind of heavily in the film. H&M definitely is one of the most egregious offenders when it comes to fast fashion. It makes me ashamed to be such an avid customer of theirs. Yet, like thousands upon millions of others, I find their products to be too cheap to consider most other brands or stores that may have more ethically made and environmentally friendly clothing products, but are often times significantly more expensive. I mean, I would love to have everything I own be sustainably made, in a way that doesn’t harm the environment. But I don’t have the money for that. As a response to Ken’s question, that is the root of the problem. The vast majority of consumers can’t help but support these big corporations and companies who are harming both workers and the environment so much: the products are too affordable to do otherwise. And as long as all of these people continue to see places like H&M as their most financially wise option, there will always be a large market, a large amount of demand for those companies to supply to. 
   <br><br>


It’s a pessimistic view, admittedly, but I don’t foresee the fast fashion industry dying off anytime soon. I think it’s too Herculean a task to get so many millions of people to change their consumption habits in a significant way that will cause real change in the industry. At least, not with the way our (capitalistic) society currently is. 

   <br><br>

I was definitely not prepared for that one scene in the film where the police in Cambodia started firing upon the textile workers for demanding fair wages. At first, when they were talking about their demands and said they wanted $160 minimum wages, my eyes literally widened and I was like “WHAT?!”, but then they went on to say that they meant $160 a month. A MONTH. That’s less than $2000 a year, extraordinarily below any kind of lower class yet still livable salary in the United States. And the police killed people for demanding those wages. I was so, so saddened to watch that one individual dying in their own pool of blood, just for participating in demanding a minimum wage that is, to us as Americans, so astronomically low and unthinkable.

“The True Cost” is also in my top 3 favorite films for this course. I also felt called out as I returned from the class and took a look at my wardrobe. I have a decent amount of clothing from H&M and it never really hit me why I was purchasing these items so abundantly. The price played a big role in my purchases and it was no surprise to me that I heavily leaned towards fast fashion. However, upon watching this documentary I now know the truth of the fashion industry. Companies like H&M were exposed in this film and I have to say I am very scared by the impacts of fast-fashion on people in Third World countries. I can relate to your comment when you stated that you want to purchase clothing items that are helpful towards the environment, but simply do not have the money to do so. I am a pessimist and can see a way we can all escape fast-fashion. Unless environmental options are cheaper, I don’t see our capitalist driven economy can convince consumers to purchase the more expensive environmental option when compared to the dirt cheap fast-fashion option. The thought that people are dying and their blood is being expended for the clothes that I am wearing on a daily basis is horrifying.

After having watched the film The True Cost I am utterly disgusted in myself and in our society for what we have allowed these corporations to create. We have basically been sponsoring the suffering and near enslavement of people in less developed countries for our material addiction. So many people suffer just so that we can be able to spend money we don’t have to buy more and more things that we don’t need. I attended a Catholic high school and world injustice was put into our curriculum, we watched films that were very similar to these. We watched and learned about numerous of other injustices that occur around the world due to cooperations and their support of unfair labor practices. We learned about the child labor practices occurring in the Ivory Coast of Africa in the Chocolate industry as well Nike’s unfair labor practices in Indonesia and other developing Asian countries. The greed these countries exhibit from their labor practices to their massive carbon footprint is an issue that can no longer be exempted and one that needs to be attacked. The injustice that is occurring is beyond wrong, not only are the workers in these LDCs getting barely getting to work in dangerous sweatshops but the will also be the same to be most affected by climate change. A change this system we have created is overdue, it is more damaging than rewarding in a global context.  We have caused so much in those who work for goods, form chemicals poisoning them from contaminated water to the workplace being an immense danger for them only to earn a dollar or two dollars a day. The United States is supposed to be the global leader yet all we are doing is leading the world to its own destruction.

There were several moments in the film where I thought I was going to cry. I've always understood that fast fashion was bad but this documentary really put things into perspective. In one specific part, they interviewed a woman and she was smiling and discussing the care she puts into her work. But as she begins to describe it, she breaks down. She discusses how much blood and hours are put into each clothing piece and how her hope is that people recognize the tears she and others put when they support these large companies. Fast fashion has given Americans access to a variety of styles for a cheap tag price and the lives of those who make it possible. It was heartbreaking when they previewed the building that collapsed, killing a hundred people. People are forced to work in harsh circumstances so that they can support themselves and their families, but they're not even being paid enough. In another interview, a woman was begging for a better wage of $160 for a month's work. Why is that so hard?
   <br><br>

Unfortunately, I have had my fair share participating in fast fashion so I understand the appeal. Cheap clothing sounds like a good deal but after watching "The True Cost," I've realized it is not so cheap after all. So many lives are being put in danger, and some are forcing themselves to work in unfair circumstances yet still barely making a decent living. Fast fashion is so ingrained into our shopping culture, and it's unbelievable how many stores are still standing today when you walk into any mall. While thrifting has become a trend and hopefully inspires more people to do that instead of supporting these large companies, it still does not hide the fact that people like cheap clothing. The climate crisis is here and I do believe that we need to make changes in our lives. Like Thoreau, we need to simplify and focus on things we need versus things we want. While that does not mean completely relinquishing what you do have, cutting down is necessary.

I share your feelings of sadness and heartbreak having watched “The True Cost.”

It is scary to see how real people are affected by industries like the fast fashion industry and I think it’s important for us to witness where our products come from and what kind of workplace these laborers are placed in. This film definitely put that into perspective for me and it saddens me to think that so many of our superficial and meaningless desires for clothing and other materialistic possessions trace back to people and their children working in such unethical conditions and circumstances. It is one thing to consider how we unethically treat animals in the meat and dairy industry and its negative effect on our environment, but it is another to think of the unethical treatment of humans enforced by humans. I, too, am guilty of buying from these fast fashion companies and have realized the real cost of these items despite the number on the price tag. This fast fashion industry is costing lives. Being more conscious consumers begins with this kind of awareness and I am hopeful that others have the opportunity to be made aware of this.

The Patriot Act with Hassan Minhaj episode was really good. I found the use of humor and sarcasm to be refreshing, but still it was incredibly informative in a very short amount of time. I think that this educational approach is going to be a new and improved way to get information into the hands of the public. This is content that people would want to see: it is funny, it is quick, it is making you smarter, but not by necessarily making you feel bad. Documentaries are scarcely even watched by the people who would like to learn about the issues they discuss– they are usually sad and sometimes they won't even tell you how to fix the problem they've been discussing the entirety of the film. 
   <br><br>
"The True Cost" compared to "The Ugly Cost of Fashion" is emotional, it takes more time, while it tells the story that needs to be told– of the hardships of fast fashion workers in other countries– it puts a drag on the conscience in a way that might make viewers give up. I don't want to say that one is better than the other, they are both great sources of information, each with their own strengths– however I will say that I believe "The Ugly Cost of Fashion" is more palatable, easy to access, and enjoyable and therefore might be the superior educational medium.

After watching the film, "The True Cost" I realized how much fashion, and clothing affects the environment, and contributes to the climate crisis heavily.  It is astonishing the fact that the United States is prolific for releasing CO2 and greenhouse gases making the climate crisis worse and worse.  This being known the United States only makes about 3% of its clothes compared to the past where the United States made about 97% of its clothing.  This shows that other countries such as China and Bangladesh are the ones making, and producing clothing for the United States.  This is very harmful for many reasons.  For one, the transportation of clothing that must be made causes a lot of CO2 to be released only contributing to the Climate Crisis.  Instead of making the cause better it makes it worse.  Because of the distance there has to be travel whether it be through the air or through the ocean.  And once it arrives to the United States it must be transported by automobile to wherever the destination is.  This is a very long process and releases a lot of CO2 into the atmosphere.  As well as, the people who are making the clothing, the people who are working at the infamous sweat shops are stuck there because they can not get another job.  And they need the money to survive.  There was an example of a building that was collapsed and killed about 1000 people.  The workers also mentioned about how the building was not safe and how it had cracks in it.  This is very horrific and heartbreaking, nobody should be treated in this manner at all.  These same people are paid almost nothing for making these products.

I agree that the way that role the United States plays in the fast fashion that contributes greenhouse gases to the environment is terrible. With about 97% of manufacturing being done outside the United States, the third world countries such as China where goods are produced are suffering from a combination of the dangerous emissions and poor conditions in these factories. People are dying because they are forced to work in ill equipped factories that are hazardous to their health, just to produce cheap goods for us to consume and rapidly dispose of. These massive corporations are willing to prioritize profit or efficiency over ethical practices in terms of the conditions the workers endure and the impact that they have on the environment.
   <br><br>

Personally I'm a big fan of second hand clothing from places like thrift stores. I like it because the prices are much more reasonable, but if doing is better for the environment then it's a win-win. A small percent of the population utilizing thrift store is not enough though. A larger scale shift away from fast fashion is necessary if we want to see any real progress.

Before diving into “The True Cost”, I already had an idea on how fast fashion thrives on the expenses of cheap labor, inhumane working conditions, and massive destruction to our planet, yet this film did an excellent job in expanding on this issue. I was very young when I first learned about fast fashion and the negative consequences it has on people and the environment. Thus, it has now been years since I’ve been careful with making my clothes last for a long time so I don’t have the need to keep buying unnecessary clothes all the time, especially trying to avoid fast fashion stores as well. However, I do wish more people transitioned from shopping for clothes regularly to just embracing what they already own and making it special to them. I have heard many responses as to why these people “can’t” switch to buying less clothes or at least avoiding the big stores: “One person not buying clothes from Forever 21 is not going to help the workers or help the planet.” “Everyone is buying it, if I don’t buy it then it wouldn’t really make a difference either way.” All fair responses but really close-minded. If we keep thinking with this mentality and attitude, we’re going to end up like the boomer’s generation to which we claim to be more “open” to changes than them. Furthermore, throughout the film I found myself thinking how capitalism has Americans so hypnotized in trying to buy the next new thing that they don’t really stop and think where exactly are these products coming from or how they get made. With all the stuff we get advertist daily, from our phones to billboards, it’s almost as if this system is trying to prevent Americans from seeing behind the scenes because the truth is ugly. A moment in the film that really angered me was when Kate Ball-Young, a former sourcing manager, was asked if it bothers her that garment workers were working in a factory making clothes for Americans or Europenas and she replied by saying no, I needed a moment to process that. Kate knows exactly how the “factory” that these works work in is built, how they have low wages, how children labor is used, how inhumane it is and she still had the audacity to say that they could be doing worse stuff. That’s exactly part of the problem, these people think that workers are living a comfortable life thanks to the opportunity of them having a job. Yes, they’re working but at what cost? The non-existing wage? The product is being made but is the process of making this product really worth it? I’m glad this film made me reflect on so many things in my life, but I’m more glad that it made me sad and angry because that anger makes you want to change something about the way things are.

I was wondering who taught you about the fast fashion industries and the negative consequences it has when you were very young? How old were you exactly? I find that very interesting to hear because when I was a kid, I did not know or think too in depth about clothing. All I cared about was toys, candy and playing. I grew up to be one of the individuals who want more and more clothes, I seem to never get enough. I wonder to myself if I was taught how my life would have been now. In what ways did they explain to you for you to understand since you were very very young? 
   <br><br>
Also, I completely agree with your comment on capitalism. This film was extremely effective at communicating its subject by allowing the viewers to understand the social, economic, ethical and environmental problems of the fashion industry. The film uses many emotional and intellectual appeals in order to express the harsh condition that these fashion workers are going through. Also, the interviews with individuals are highly effective because we get to hear the stories of the individuals whose voices are not heard. I love how the film spreads awareness and educates consumers since many people are unaware and/or do not deeply think about where their clothing comes from. It is very disheartening to have observed the conditions in which half of the population who are considered to be below the poverty line (mainly third world countries) are treated in the workplace and their way of life. I am upset and completely shocked about how good the fashion industries cover up their awful conditions by placing their new clothing onto models while there is no credit given to the makers of these articles of clothing.
   <br><br>
Overall, I am just as upset as you are and loved all your comments. The film did a great job on giving the details on how our environment is affected while touching base on the people’s lives who have been affected/ruined because of people's selfishness.

After watching this episode, I immediately thought about all the clothes in my closet from Forever 21 and H&M, and felt guilty. Companies like this are so harmful, and I feel like they are harmful in ways that are being swept under the rug. The fashion industry is so massive, and it preys on our insecurities and our desires. Similarly to cars, having certain clothes gives you status, and companies like Zara and Forever 21 are giving us that status at an extremely low price. It can be very difficult to say no.
   <br><br>

My parents have always been big thrifers. For most of my life, the majority of my clothes were second hand. I didn’t think anything of this because to me it seemed so normal. I didn’t have insecurities about it because I knew my parents weren’t poor, so my second hand clothes weren’t out of necessity, but out of preference. It wasn’t until middle school that I met a specific group of friends who had negative reactions to my second-hand clothes. That didn’t stop me from buying them, but it did make me think about how people saw thrifting
   <br><br>

Now, thrifting is trendy. Oversized sweaters and vintage pants -- wearing them makes you cool, and many of those things are found at thrift stores. I hope thrifting becomes even more trendy, and I hope the trend spreads further than my liberal bubble.

The documentary 'The True Cost' gives an overview of the damaging impacts of the fashion industry on individuals and the environment. Only 3% of clothing in America is made in the country, the rest is outsourced from developing countries. The garment factories in the developing countries have horrible working conditions, low wages and heavily pollute the areas, thereby affecting people's health and standards of life. The issue however is that these countries rely on the business and jobs created by these sweatshop factories. Countries are competing over who can produce the cheapest clothing for the developed world's companies. Factories aren't the only polluting factor in the fashion industry. The heavy use of pesticides in the cotton industry has contaminated the soil and caused numerous health problems for individuals working in or near the fields. Due to the vast consumerism of the western world and fast fashion an incredible amount of clothes are discarded in developing countries.  This has set off a series of problems for the clothing industries within countries since the demand is low since  people can get clothes for free.

The video “The Ugly Truth Of Fast Fashion” is the best one so far. The speaker is using a funny way to convey the tedious data and fact to the audience, which is really an efficient way to leads the consumer approach the real problem. It’s hard to convince people to seat there and watch a long serious documentary about the story behind manufacture, but by the means of a talk show, people will actively explore the truth. For me, the fact that cloth industry has such low efficiency turning raw material to product shocks me. What’s worse is that none of the consumer realize that. The problem is that people are trained by industry to consume more and more with unlimited desire but unconscious about the damage we have done to the environment. What if people can see the effect of their consumption? just like the horrific image on the packing of cigarette. For example, I feel nothing when I eat pork, but the process of killing them makes feel sad. This can apply to almost all industries. If people can know about how much water is wasted to produce one pants, they might decide to buy less and suppress their desire to acquire more. If the American dream is having more goods and consume more, it will eventually break since all these stuffs come from the natural resources, which are limited.

In Hasan Minhaj’s episode on fast fashion, he describes the resources that are being wasted and how fast fashion companies - such as Zara and H&M - say that they are using strategies that are helping to save the planet by participating in recycling programs and making sure that they use reusable and sustainable products for their clothes. He first goes into the idea of fast fashion and how they are pumping products by the week, citing that H&M are bringing in clothes three times a week, and instead of having four seasons of the year for clothing, they have “52 seasons” accounting for the 52 weeks of the year. With new clothes coming in every week and the trash that comes from the the clothes that are either not sold or “recycled” that can no longer be used. 

   <br><br>

However, after he discusses the fast fashion’s business model, including how they sell products and try to recreate products that look like high-end fashion, such as Zara’s version of the $800 Balenciaga’s that “look like socks,” Hasan goes into depths about the marketing schemes - or, better put, lies - that these fast fashion industries make. They say that they are using recyclable material and that they are incorporating sustainable practices within their production of the clothing that they easily sell. For example, the amount of water that they use in order to create a person’s jacket can supply the same amount of water for a person for 24 years. When Hasan opened up his “H-M” store, it showed the actual production process and what it took in order to create those products, and when people said that they had no idea, they were genuine. For example, when the tag said that the product was reusable, and Hasan said that the only thing that was recyclable within the product was the tag. He also talked about the amount of clothes people buy, which in the 80s’, was around 18 pieces of clothing, but during the contemporary, it is roughly around 64 per person. 
   <br><br>


All this waste is the cycle that is continuing to create the climate crisis. Hasan stated that the clothes that we pack for a plane do more harm to our planet the plane itself. We see that all of these issues, especially consumerism, continue to place detrimental impacts within our planet. We need to make sure that we can change our habits and try our best to change the societal perspective of what we think about clothes. Because we always need new clothes, we need to make sure that we buy more, and then when we buy more, we waste more - roughly around 80 pounds a year - which continues to cause these clothes to burn, in countries such as Kenya, they place more carbon emissions within the Earth - this cycle kills our planet. We need to do a better job of making sure that we resort to better, actual recyclable materials instead of faking it for the clout and the ignition of the cycle.

The relationship between the corporation and the perpetuating consumer or vice versa seems quite complex. I could see how you could make a case that big corporations are to blame or that consumers are causing the problem. I'd have to argue that both are to blame. We in many ways perpetuate and give into the corporate and major marketing schemes by continuing to consume at the levels we do. At the same time, and perhaps more frustrating, is that there are smart people thinking of new ways to get us to buy new things and consume as much as possible. I think the solution also lies in these two root issues. Consumers need to be more aware of their consumption habits and the impact that they are having. Fashion and cosmetic companies need to also value the concept of quality products. It is hard to decide wether this should be a bottom up or top down approach. Should Government regulation penalize these companies for their poor quality products? Or should the companies themselves take their own initiatives to reduce their impact and influence on our society of consumption?

I found this film to be very powerful.  I have seen films addressing similar topics in the past, but it is always good to be reminded of.  I was again reminded of how much I, individually buy into the fast fashion industry.  It’s so easy to do, the clothes are very accessible to me, and they are within my price range.  I have always loved fashion, and so playing with lots of clothes has always been fun for me, and this is easier of course to do, when prices are so convenient.  Recently, I have been trying to buy more clothing from thrift/secondhand stores.  This has also become a trendy thing to do for our generation.  I know many people don’t like the fact that thrifting has become a trend, but I think it is wonderful.  It doesn’t matter the reason, it means that more people are getting their clothes second-hand.  
   <br><br>


While of course, the stories of the factory workers were very impactful, what was new to me was the stories of the farmers.  I didn’t think about the fact that so much of the clothing industry uses chemicals on their crops.  Further, I guess, I didn’t think about how much that would impact those who work in the fields.  The cotton farmer was right when she mentioned that we don’t think about cotton in the same way that we think about our food.  The importance of not using chemicals still stands.  Another thing that really struck me about this film, was to hear the stories of the workers in Cambodia, their protests demanding 160 US dollars a month.  I make more money a month than they do, working 6 hours a week, and I know that they work tirelessly all day and all week.  It’s crazy to think about that way.  While I know that minimum wages where I come from in San Diego aren’t sufficient to pay for living in San Diego, I also know that it in no way compares to that of these poorer countries.

What once used to be an amazing form of art has turned into something dreadful. Fast fashion is taking over the fashion industry and it's soiling it. The documentary, "The True Cost" does an excellent job in showing how the fashion industry has spiraled down hill and is contributing to the world's carbon footprint nearly as much as oil companies are. I was astonished to learn that before the United States began to purchase fashion items from third world countries, we used to make most of our products. Now that fast fashion has taken over only 3% of our clothing is made here in the U.S and the other 97% is made overseas. I was pretty upset to see how the living and working conditions were for the workers in the sweatshops and was even more upset when talk show hosts and news stations laughed at this and played it off by saying things such as, "they're doing a job, they could be doing worse things" or "these are places where people choose to work". These people are living in worse conditions than us because of our actions and are forced to work here because there are no alternatives for them and are still treated horribly like they're less of a human being. The Rana Plaza incident that killed nearly 1000 workers really had a lasting impact on me while i continued to watch the film because innocent lives were lost while people here in the U.S enjoyed what was made for them. 
   <br><br>


Imagine working at a place where your boss beats you because you might be slacking off, where you can't spend time with your family because this industry is so demanding of its workers, where the water is poisoned by all the insecticides used to prevent insects from eating up the cotton which constitutes most of our clothes, where you might lose your job because someone is willing to risk their life just so that they can get paid $3 an hour or even worse $10 a month and then go into debt. Imagine forcing whole communities to do all the labor work just so that you can slack off and enjoy life while they suffer. This industry is almost worth $3 trillion and still treats their workers like actual shit and that is honestly unethical and not acceptable. 

   <br><br>

Most of these people have no voice so I think that we the people of the United States should be their voice and step up against these evil corporations such as how "People Tree" was doing and force fair trade and practice for these workers. These CEOs and top groups of people don't know what actual pain is, they never had to accept the fact that their child was dying because of all the toxins that surrounded them, they most likely never had to deal with a suicide on their conscious because that person was unable to provide for their family, they never had to be separated from their families for years apart because that was the only way to survive. We need real change fast to prevent the agony that these families must be facing overseas, because if we don't it's most likely going to hit us back.

The true cost was eye opening to me. I was aware of bad working conditions for people in other countries working in the garment industries, but I did not know the extent. They are being paid horribly and even losing their lives to please other people. They are people too and do not deserve to be treated like this for our greedy benefits. Seeing the Rana Plaza disaster was painful to watch from a screen and I cannot even imagine being there or having a loved one involved in the tragedy. Fast fashion is completely unnecessary to anyone and deserves to be stopped. I personally wear the same simple pieces of clothing religiously and only buy clothes when I absolutely need to. I also do not really care what clothes I wear as long as they look nice enough and are comfortable, so I do not see the issue or difficulty people face with cutting down on shopping. Clothes to me, are more of a necessity than a want. To answer the question of who is to blame for fast fashion’s harm, the consumers or companies, I think both are at fault. Without the consumers companies would not need to use cheap labor to make their items. Similarly, without the company’s desire for a seemingly endless amount of money, the garment industry would be better paid in other countries and conditions would be better. 
   <br><br>


It is absurd to me that the average amount of clothing bought per year is 60 items, that is more clothing than I currently own and have probably owned less than that in the past 3 years. I believe other industries are following suit regarding “fast-fashion” like the electronic sector making new products yearly that are very similar, just more expensive with minor upgrades. This relates back to the idea of planned obsolescence that was talked about in “The Waste Makers”. If people do not limit their consumption of clothes and other unnecessary items, people will continue to be harmed and our planet will meet its fate.

As someone who buys a lot of clothes, I started to feel bad about my decisions as I continued watching this film. I’m someone who gets a lot of joy from clothes, wearing new things and being able to put together outfits that, in my opinion, look cute. It’s always been one of my favorite things to go shopping and try on and buy clothes that I thought were adorable. But after watching this, I thought of the many people who had to work for me just to get my shirt. It made me feel bad for the things I have in my closet and make me want to rethink my next shopping trip. I’ve been using eBay and other sites like it to buy my clothes since moving to college because I’ve had less money, and now that I know the impact buying new clothes has, I’ll definitely try to stick to used clothing more often.
   <br><br>


One thing I truly never thought of when buying my clothes is the cotton or other items that are being grown to make them. I, of course, thought about the people making them, but never the ingredients involved. It shocked me to learn the harsh environmental impacts those items had on the world. The fact that seventy to eighty kids are mentally challenged in some villages really shocks me. What shocks me more is that they continue to release these toxic fertilizers even after knowing what they will do. The True Cost has definitely made me rethink my shopping choices.

You shouldn’t need to feel guilty about the clothes that you buy. We all should be able to find joy in certain things without anyone else ruining it for us. And essentially that is what the fast fashion industry have done to us. It’s none of our individual faults that we are easily persuaded to purchase from companies like H&M and Zara because they’re affordable and in style. 
   <br><br>

Instead we should focus that attention and negative emotions on pushing these companies to do better. We can do so by buying less from these companies and making our products from them last longer, or buying from more sustainable companies to send a message that we as consumers won’t tolerate the poor treatment of their workers and wasteful culture. I agree with you and know that most people don’t really think about the process and ingredients it takes to make our clothes. It shouldn’t have to be something that we worry about and I’m glad that this film and episode were able to highlight that.

The film was effective at communicating its subject because it provides multiple serious problems and the negative effects of the “fast fashion" industry. The film successfully exposing the essentially deceptive nature of the fast fashion industry by presenting interviews from various people among different countries and revealing the consequences it has had on our environment, economy, and health. Also, this film persuades audiences to take this subject seriously and gives people the motivation to solve the problems.
   <br><br>

From my perspective, this film’s audience is most likely casual viewers, rather than people already concerned about the issue. "The True Cost" presents many personal experiences and the problems that appeared in our environment instead discusses many professional questions and theories. Further, the film exposes the vast difference between the factories that make cheap material with unsafe chemicals to ones that produce fancy streamers, which introduce a brand-new world to me as a casual viewer. It is such a helpful informative film that makes people acknowledge the “fast fashion” industry in today’s world. Watching this film is such a wide-eyed improvement for me. Because the only informative sources of my clothes are just the tags that come with them, which are just the place of production, the constituent, and the washing symbols. I had never really thought about who made my clothes and under what kinds of conditions. But the film showed me about workers' suffering from making a living for themselves and their families by making those clothes that we going to purchase later on. From this film, I learned that the true cost of our clothes is much more the number on their tags. I don't think this film changed my attitude because it actually gives me an attitude and a perspective on viewing the production of clothes. Since many people who have already started fighting for this case, I feel optimistic and I believe we can solve this problem in the future.

I thought that "The Ugly Cost of Fast Fashion" was an interesting take on the fast fashion industry. While the comedic relief was appreciated, I thought that Hasan did a great job unpacking a lot of information quickly. I thought that the pop up store was a really unique touch also, as it was not only was it a great way to interact with the public but it also gave them immediate correction of some of their previous misconceptions about fashion companies and their misleading labels. 
   <br><br>

I think that fashion more than anything stands as a cry for change in our consumerist system. Fast fashion starts with dirty and unethical production, transportation, and ultimately when the wearer has decided that they don't like the item anymore, the clothes are usually doomed to be trashed or even burned after what might seem like the eco-conscious choice of donating. The constant pressure put on people to buy is absurd and even more so when looking at the taxation to the environment. I believe in the video that Hasan said H&M gets new clothing shipments four times a week! And all for those clothes to just be burned up, I cannot think of a more reckless way to waste resources. 
   <br><br>

"The True Cost" was also an incredibly interesting film when I watched it back in Engl 22. Before watching it, I knew that fast fashion was bad and that should be avoided but I had no idea about the extreme exploitation of workers, hazardous working conditions, and the disgusting environmental impacts. I have never been a shopaholic and normally must be dragged to the store for new clothes, but even so, "The True Cost" made me re-evaluate how and where and why I get my new clothes. Thrifting has become a major player in terms of where I get clothes. I think that the most important thing I got out of the film was a new respect for the clothes that I do have and a motivation to make sure that I wear them until they can no longer be worn.

I agree with your comment. I loved that the truth of the fast fashion industries was presented in such an easy going comedic way by Hasan Minhaj. This enabled me to grasp the facts easily and in an intriguing way. I also really loved the fact that he opened up the pop up H-M to physically interact with consumers and impact them in a more literal and obvious way. 
   <br><br>
I used to work at a retail store downtown and we used to get shipment quite frequently. I never really understood how we got tons of the same items every week and where they would go when we didn’t sell them. We also had a policy where we couldn’t give a discount to people if they complained that a piece of clothing had a tear/stain. If we had a complaint and someone wanted a discount, we would have to take back the item, tear it up, and throw it away, and send it back to the district manager with a note describing what was wrong with it. This obviously sucked and angered everyone and it’s even more frustrating knowing that new pieces of clothing cause so much harm to peoples’ carbon footprints.
   <br><br>
I think I definitely learned a lot about the fashion industry and will definitely be more resistant to buying “that new shirt I need” whenever I go out, wear my clothes for way longer, and ultimately stop buying clothes I can most likely find at thrift stores.

<br><hr>
I feel like the 'just get rid of it' mentality permeates a lot of business standards in ways that are not at all hidden. Hearing Hasan Minhaj go through his act on fast fashion was incredibly informative about specifics impacts of the industry on the environment. I have tried to stay away from fast fashion for a while now, shopping mostly at thrift stores and going to clothing swaps and things like that, but I can’t say I’ve been completely removed from it.
   <br><br>

There will still be times where I’ll find myself browsing online for things I absolutely don’t need for no particular reason other than it functions as a sort of entertainment. Though how we express ourselves through clothing etc. can be super fun, it doesn’t have to drain our resources and exploit people by utilizing fabrics that are bad for the environment and being produced under horrific standards.

This movie was definitely the most heartbreaking one out of the ones we watched so far, for me at least. I knew fast fashion was a problem, but to the extent the movie showed it to be? I don’t think anything could have prepared me for the shot of the poor man soaked in blood. It’s a film everyone needs to see to understand that the problem is far from clothes… it’s now a human rights and ethics issue. I could feel the pain of all the mothers working every day for little pay and only being able to see their kids 3 or 2 times a year. It’s unacceptable and it really broke me down. One of the most powerful quotes from this movie was when one of the sweatshop workers who was a focus of the movie said in tears, “I don’t want people wearing clothes made from our blood.” The film did a great job of bringing humanity at its most vulnerable to the public eye and we must face it. We can’t ignore the conditions of these workers no matter what “code of conduct” greedy corporations have established. The whole situation is a nightmare. The movie also did a great job of educating people about the harmful consequences stemming from the chemicals used to quicken the production of cotton. Now it’s killing people in our own country too, right in Texas. Consumption has to be a disease if buying a $5 shirt comes at the cost of a mother working hard in Bangladesh to give her children a better life. I wish more people were aware about the process in which their clothes are made.

This film was also one of the harder ones for me to watch. I hadn’t really known too much about how extremely horrible the fast fashion industry is. It was so hard to see that people are actually living their lives like this, just so the clothes that we buy can be cheaper and we can consume more stuff that we don’t even need. I agree that this is a serious ethics issue that needs to be seen and understood by everyone. A lot of people don’t see the other side of where their cheap Forever 21 shirt came from and I would bet that if they did, they would think twice about buying it and supporting a system like that. I have bought from companies that are a part of this system, but after watching this video, I have realized that literal lives are sacrificed in other countries in order to try and keep up with American consumer culture and society, and that just isn’t worth it. This has made me realize that I don’t need to support these companies and that the best way to shop is to not only thrift, but to thrift smart. You can go thrifting, yet still support these fast fashion industries, just not directly. 
    <br><br>
While I was watching the film, I had a hard time actually seeing that families and children live like that. We are so lucky to be able to live the lives we do and most of us abuse that blessing. This film, while extremely depressing and hard to watch, has to be seen and should be used as inspiration for people like us to use our privilege and work towards equality and human  rights for everyone as well as improving the state of our planet. While I can’t expect this from everyone, I hope a lot of people actually listen to this issue and leave this class knowing that something needs to change and that individual choices and actions, like boycotting fast fashion or eating a plant-based diet, can help facilitate that change. I too wish that more people were aware about this issue, but all we can do is spread the word and educate others on what we know.

Okay, first of all, I had never seen this show Patriot Act, but I really enjoyed this episode so thank you, Ken, for putting me on a new Netflix show. The way Hasan Minhaj weaves together humor and hard-hitting facts is effective for reaching audiences that may have not been initially interested in environmental sustainability. I definitely knew about the ecological dangers of fast fashion, but I was surprised by some facts brought up in this episode like how Fashion Nova recreated Kim Kardashian’s dress within 24 hours. It’s insane to me how they can operate that quickly and how on top of it they are. Echoing Minhaj, I understand why fast fashion brands mimic high fashion - the same look for cheaper, who doesn’t want that? However, when the detrimental effects are brought to light consumers must consider all aspects of what it takes to produce the product they’re interested in purchasing. 
    <br><br>


It’s simply annoying how H&M and Zara execute greenwashing because to the uninformed consumer they will truly believe that their line is eco-friendly. I remember having a conversation with a friend about fast fashion and I mentioned how H&M is unethical. She insisted that the brand is actually environmentally friendly because they have the “conscious” line. So, yeah, it definitely gives consumers the entirely wrong idea. Poor quality, disposable clothing is obviously environmentally disastrous, but I wonder how we can slow down or bring this process to a halt? On an individual level we can stop shopping at fast fashion stores, but how many people have to stop for the brand to stop producing? As Ken said, corporations basically blame consumers because we’re the ones creating the demand, but it seems as though there’s overproduction and not enough people to buy all the clothes made. That being said, if many people stop shopping, won’t they still continue to overproduce? Personally, I now only buy secondhand clothing, but I wonder if I should steer clear of fast fashion brands that are found in thrift stores? Or is all of the used clothing fair game? How does this contribute to textile waste? 
    <br><br>


Although fashion companies and marketing tactics play a huge role in consumerism, I think individuals can greatly reduce their desire for more clothing or more trendy clothing simply by reevaluating their values. Yes, it’s hard when everyone around you has the new fashionable pair of shoes and are showing it off on Instagram, but deep down does it really matter?

While watching the film, The True Cost, I felt uneasy, uncomfortable and scared. Before watching the film, I thought that fast fashion was a business scheme for fashion companies such as Forever21 to produce and sell cheap clothes for an affordable price, thus getting people to buy their trendy clothes and when the items wear off, these customers will return to buy more. I would have never imagined that fast fashion implied and meant so much more that I initially perceived it. 
    <br><br>
 It is disturbing how the fashion industry specifically targets Benghadish for clothes production. These fashion companies know that fabric workers depend on their business to earn a wage so they exploit their powers to demand much more than its manageable for these production industries, yet these production companies have no other choice to accept the brand store’s demand. So these extreme conditions that the production industry has to meet annually to satisfy and keep business going, massive disasters such as the one that occurred in Rana Plaza have occurred and several more just like it. 
    <br><br>
 Catastrophic events such as the Rana Plaza disaster showcase the corruption and manipulation in part of the fast fashion and the whole fashion industry in general. They are responsible for the death of 931 workers and more injured. But although we want to blame these massive corporations for disasters, we have to look into our own society and realize that we are also the problem. The overwhelming need of women and men to stay in trend (look “fresh”) is a self-serving and egotistical mentality, but we are all at fate for this. All of us have fallen for advertising, fooling us to believe that we need and want the latest Nike shoe design, Campaign hoodie, and more, although the reality is that we cannot even afford those items. 
    <br><br>
 Now knowing the complete implications that come with fast fashion, I am going to think about those female workers whose time went into making a single clothing piece and how many like them have made the rest of the clothing in the store. I will remember how these women are treated unfairly and how they are barely surviving with what they are given for their labor-intensive job. I am going to look back at those awful images of women and men protesting against their work conditions and them being killed, injured and arrested for breaking with the status quo. I will definitely think twice and maybe the triple time before ever buying a fast fashion clothing piece.

The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion does a great job at exposing fast fashion while still keeping it interesting and entertaining. Hasan exposes the problems and misleading claims that stores like Zara and H/M make that try to trick customers into believing that the company’s products are actually sustainable. Not only are these companies lying to their customers, they’re destroying the planet. Tons of resources go into making these clothes, everything from oil and natural gas to water. I was amazed to see how well these companies are able to rip off famous clothing brands and label them as knockoffs. These lower tier brands like Zara and H/M are able to make these copies of products without being sued by the big companies for counterfeiting their items. These companies aren’t the only ones to blame though. As Americans, we burn through tons of clothes week after week and heavily contribute to the disaster that is fast fashion. The idea of the 52 week season is absolutely astonishing to me. How could anyone change up their clothes that often for that long? I just don’t see how people buy so many pieces of clothing in such a short amount of time. Consumerism in America has destroyed the environment and has had an impact of what Americans now think is the standard of fashion or the american dream. So many material items like fashion or cars or any other material good have become the center of American lives. These companies have one goal, and that is to get people to buy their product, no matter the consequences. This is one big problem as these companies should realize and take responsibility for all of the destruction they’re causing on such a large scale.

Hassan Minaj does an excellent job in giving his audience the information on the fast fashion catastrophe quickly, and in a relatively entertaining way (not a surprise for Hassan Minaj does many things amazingly and anything short of that is not expected because he's amazing)
    <br><br>

It is important to notify the public of what goes on in the production of their clothes. As good of a documentary that "The True Cost" is, it is lengthy and doesn't have a large audience. Hassan's show, being available on Netflix and only 20 minutes, is an excellent way to start the spread of the information on that topic. 
    <br><br>

He is funny (very, as a matter of fact) which makes his videos entertaining, and aren't for the sole purpose of education. He does a good job balancing the two. 
    <br><br>

In fact, I personally started watching Hassan's show because I wanted to laugh in a short period of time 
    <br><br>
(compared to long 2 hour comedy specials). It was bonus that I began learning about all of the prevalent issues he speaks of. 

    <br><br>
A personal favorite part of the episode was when he opened the pop-up shop where he informed the public on specifics of the lies fast fashion industry. It was eye opening and ridiculous to see the extent that these corporations go to in order to convince us that they're more "sustainable" than they actually are.
    <br><br>

Specifically, when a major brand led the consumer to believe that the product is recycled when indeed only the tag was recycled was very funny, but more disappointing.

I had no idea the extent of how horrible the lives are of these workers’. I put on my clothes this morning with slight disgust and confusion, as I now know what conditions these people are being put through to make the clothes on my back. This documentary does a great job at incorporating all sides of the argument from the media in order to really see the issue going on here and why it has been such a struggle to be stopped. We saw clips of the big capitalist businesses that make the most financial gain from fast fashion, as well as clips of businesses trying to stop fast fashion and gain awareness for the issue at hand. We also saw clips of the workers themselves. I now understand how clothes have lost such an incredible value, and that businesses today want to make you feel more rich by being able to buy more clothes. One of the hardest parts of the film for me to watch was when the 8-story building in India collapsed, killing 70 people. This building was used as a factory to produce clothes for Americans, and in the film it even said that people had tried over and over to tell their supervisors that there were cracks in the ceiling. But the supervisors wouldn’t listen, not until the building collapsed and killed people. How can people be treated this way? And how is it possible that any of this is actually being justified, even by one person?
    <br><br>

It is inhumane and disgusting.
    <br><br>

What I will say is that since I started at UCSB in Fall 2018, I have been to a handful of IV Trading Post Pop-Ups and Zero-waste events. And everytime I go to one of these events, I walk out, having spent $0-$20, carrying a couple new pieces of second-hand clothes that I end up wearing EVERYDAY. And the amount of compliments I will sometimes receive or questions about where I got the clothes from happens often too. I think if people realize that second-hand clothes are cool, trendy, and easy to find, then this will raise awareness on the effects of fast fashion on the environment.

The film’s main goal was to spread awareness of the consequences of fast fashion. Most Americans are oblivious to the literal blood that goes into their cheap, Forever 21 t-shirt. The film used real events, narratives from specific workers, and graphic clips to convey this message. It leaves the audience feeling guilty about their problematic consumerist ways. In fact, right after the movie, I researched ethical clothing brands and hope to support their business in the future.
    <br><br>

I believe that the film’s audience are people who are already concerned with this environmental and socio economic issues. For one reason, it’s difficult to expect someone who isn’t interested in this discussion to spend 1.5 hours of their day watching the film, let alone change their shopping habits. This film is catered to people who are interested in making a change, but need a bit of a push.
    <br><br>


Most Amercains deep down know that their cheap clothing doesn’t come from the prettiest place. Some people, such as myself were too afraid to look deeper into the fast fashion industry. As I was watching this video, I felt proud of myself for not supporting fast fashion. The majority of my clothes have been bought from secondhand store. However, this is not common. I hope that the average American looks into where they purchase their clothing from. 
    <br><br>

I learned about the details of the sweatshop working conditions. I was surprised by the little media coverage these garment shops receive. I hope the people who watch this video learn from it, and change their consumer habits. Hopefully this will lead to a larger shift in the demand of ethical clothing.

Ken's question about how to best get the message across is one that I've been thinking about while taking this class. It's so incredibly difficult to dismantle our consumer culture that has been assembled for the 70+ years since World War 2 ended. It's so difficult because consumption is the way of life for quite literally every family and individual in America, regardless of socioeconomic status. In some way, buying clothes, cars, technology, and whatever else is a necessity for everybody, so approaching this question of how to best change how we consume is difficult.
    <br><br>

I'm struggling with this thought now -- my family is a prime contributor to the fast fashion industry. We buy a lot of clothes from discount stores like TJ Maxx and Marshalls and even Kohls -- because they have really cheap clothes, so why not buy them? Watching the Patriot Act episode challenged that mentality for me. It's absolutely crazy that one jacket required 10,330 liters of water, or 24 years of an individual's drinking water, to produce. That's absolutely nuts. It's really disillusioning to hear that 87% of fabric used in clothing ends up incinerated or in a landfill in a Third World country.
    <br><br>

These are the statistics I'm going to share with my family. Unfortunately yet fortunately, the statistics are so bad that most people will feel an obligation to reconsider their consumption choices. Ken's right that long documentaries are very effective but don't attract a large audience. Hasan Minhaj does a fantastic job of making the realities of the world relevant and digestible for the average person. I'm going to show this to my family and make changes to how and how often we shop.



</p><hr>


<p>

After getting through the first twenty minutes of "The True Cost," I couldn't but think: damn, I should've just watched Hassan Minhaj on Patriot Act. The documentary was truly a disgusting side of humanity to watch. Unlike the effects of climate change, which are a lot more long term, I was witnessing the effects of human greed affect those with less right in front of me. It made me feel even more sick that the cause was big corporations like H&M, stores I spent most of highschool shopping at. When talked about being in the business of "making a consumer" it really made me realize how we have been able to use economic ideals, like Capitalism, as a tool to modernize what is effectively slavery. At least thats what the plight of the workers in Bangladesh and Cambodia felt like. You have them living in horrible working conditions, having no where better to turn to. You have "managers" demanding respect with the idea they are providing a humane service to those lower than them. To top it all off, you have us suckers making a grand material profit off of their oppression. 
    <br><br>

Watching the documentary was a true experience. By the end, I found myself questioning my values and what I stand for as an American. I question if I can even be proud to be one, in fact. The message brought about in "The True Cost" brings me back to the discussion we had earlier in the quarter about an alarmist strategy of divulging information. Originally, I would've been against an alarmist way of spreading information about a crisis (such as climate change), but the fact that I have to consider how to make the defense of peoples' humanity marketable to the world??? It's sickening to me. It would be a lot easier if we were all like Larhea Pepper's grandfather: "respect the land, we’re stewards of the land, we should respect the life that’s in the land."

<p>
“The True Cost” was honestly one of the most horrifying films I have ever seen. American corporations treat people in other countries who work for sweatshops like their lives are genuinely worthless. I always knew conditions in these factories were bad, but I had no idea of the scale of deaths that are constantly happening just so us in the developed world can buy lots of cheap clothing. When the film was discussing the amount of farmer suicides and the terrible mental effects the pesticides were having on children in villages, I was absolutely appalled. It’s so deeply unfair that we have the privilege to buy as much as we want and companies get to keep making more and more money at the expense of people’s health, wellbeing, and even lives. 
    <br><br>

I feel like the majority of what we have seen and read in the class links the climate crisis back to one thing: greed. Enough people are aware of climate change that we could have already mitigated its effects if it weren’t for people in power, like those who run big fashion companies, manipulating the public for their own monetary benefit. Even though consumers aren’t totally blameless, I do think it is mainly the fault of the companies. As much as we may try to avoid advertisements, they are incredibly convincing. They use proven psychological tricks to get in people’s heads and and essentially manipulate their actions. Companies know exactly what they’re doing in advertisements and how to convince their target audience to buy their product. The most effective, and thus most evil, part of their marketing strategies is that, like Ken said, they focus on selling ideals. When the ideal of happiness is linked to a certain brand of clothing, and you’re presented with that connection multiple times, you get it in your head that without that product you won’t be happy. Of course logically this makes no sense but our impulses are rarely guided by logic.

I totally agree with you - "The True Cost" and "Fire in Paradise" affected me the most so far in this class. Seeing video footage of children with extreme health problems - physical and mental - that were caused by the chemicals it takes to produce certain items, was truly horrific. The same goes for the clip of the factory building that collapsed, killing over 1000 people. The horrible part about it all is that most people in Third World countries have to accept those life-threatening work conditions if they want to earn some money and survive. They neither have the power nor the opportunity to protest against their cruel treatment, so we are the only hope they have. Watching this documentary really made me realize that these workers depend on us to fight for them because it simply cannot go on like this any longer. Is buying a cheap shirt at H&M really more important than the survival of factory workers - most female, some even children? We really have to ask ourselves what we value more and if we can live with ourselves if we keep contributing to others suffering or dying because of our greed.

    <br><br>

I really like that you used that word - greed - to describe what is happening in this world. Most of the reasons that climate change is happening can be traced back to the fact that we are a greedy, mostly selfish society. We all say we care about other people, our planet, other countries, etc. but then we engage in behaviors and actions that prove the exact opposite. If we really cared about the survival and well-being of other, less fortunate people, then we wouldn't be buying cheap clothing from incredibly wealthy companies that make profits by manipulating us and exploiting other countries' populations, just because a particular dress is "just so cute". If we really cared about our Earth, then we wouldn't be driving our car everywhere or eating meat every day. It is truly sad that our planet will soon become uninhabitable, simply because we were too greedy or proud to change our living habits.
    <br><br>
"The True Cost" raises awareness for the problematic fashion industry and really inspired me to change the way I approach fashion or shopping.


<br><hr>
You are, unfortunately, very correct on the human horrors that the "True Cost" reveals in its film. The development of global supply chains has allowed corporations to outsource parts of the production process to parts of the world where labor is dirt cheap and health codes are not as strongly enforced or checked on a regular basis. This leads to disasters like the Rana Plaza, where hundreds of workers die at the fault of factory managers who cut corners in order to meet the increasing demands for lower prices of major apparel companies. It is important for consumers to understand and be increasingly aware of the implications of dirt cheap prices at fast-fashion retail stores like H&M and the Gap. The film makes an important note that the reduced prices of fast fashion items is only really impacting the lowest part of the supply chain in developing countries and that is where the costs are being cut. The CEOs and other high-up officials for these companies are not seeing profits decrease for them, but workers in developing countries are the ones who are seeing their wages cut, and they're the ones who desperately need the money and live in poverty as a result. I was also horrified by the high accounts of farmer suicides, and I found it so incredibly saddening that nothing is being done to negate these impacts. I know that COCs are becoming more important for companies to have, but how often are we really checking that they are being followed? How sure can we be that regulations are being enforced in certain countries where they rely on manufacturing for any source of income?
<br><hr>
I could not agree more with your thoughts on the film. Watching The True Cost honestly made me incredibly sad, it is really sickening to see the kinds of conditions that these sweatshop employees are working in almost against their will. I keep thinking to myself, how can the heads of these fast fashion chains turn a blind eye to this injustice that they are the cause of? I feel like their biggest excuses are that since it is not their country, that they are not responsible and therefore they are simply doing what is best for their companies. This is deeply frustrating. It is so cruel to be contributing to such an inhumane system, where the workers have no choice but to continue in these conditions, because it is the only jobs available to them. I think this film did an incredible job at showing the realities of the fast fashion industry, especially by interviewing the sweatshop workers themselves. While I previously knew that sweatshops existed and that these workers had to suffer horrible conditions, I never fully understood the injustices of it before this film. The most heartbreaking part was seeing one of the women crying talking about how she couldn't see her children more than a couple times a year but that she felt comfort knowing that they would live better lives than she was. How is this normal? How can we keep turning a blind eye when there are people suffering, people dying? This is almost economic slavery, but because they are not being physically forced it is ignored by the public. I can't even be upset with myself or with others who will continue to purchase these cheap products without hesitation, because we are not shown this side of the story. I think everyone should watch this film and realize what is happening, what the real price is for their cheap efficient products that they don't actually need.

I agree it is crazy how little value corporations give to the lives of their workers. The conditions that they work in for very little money is horrible, not to mention the risk of death that they face when they go to work. Corporations do this to get more production without raising costs, so we can buy cheap clothes. After watching this video, I will stop buying as much clothes and when I do, I will look for fair trade companies if possible. It is insane that the corporations are allowed to get away with this and take advantage of poorer countries all over the world.
<br><hr>
I also found "The True Cost" to be a horrifying film. The fact that companies are allowing people from 3rd world countries slave away to make their money is disgusting. Although it is disgusting, I think there is a right way to go about it. Instead of just banning the so called "sweatshop" operations completely, which would take many of these folks out of jobs and force them to do farm work most likely, I think we need to give these people fair rights and working conditions. They need to have a fair wage, first of all. Second of all, they need to be given breaks/proper hydration and food if needed. Maybe it would be a good idea for these companies to be taxed a small percentage and that money be used toward paying these slavers and giving them better conditions. 
    <br><br>


I also agree with you that greed is the root of all the problems in the climate crisis when you really dig into it. In the film, the greed of such people was evident by the way that American companies are allowing things to be run. Its not just the companies faults' either. In Rana Plaza, the higher ups in the factory lashed out to the protesters that simply were asking for more rights and better working conditions. This shows that greed can be seen everywhere, not just from American companies.



<br><hr>
I agree that the climate crisis does link back to greed. While people are becoming more aware of its consequences and are making changes to alleviate our impact, it feels like it's not enough. With large fossil-fueled companies having the power, it's disheartening to know that they are calling the shots and the wrong ones. And it is saddening to know that we are buying into it, all for the sake of a cheaper price tag. Watching this film, I definitely feel like I will be more considerate when I purchase from any fast-fashion store, but doing that does not guarantee other people will as well. The reason that companies like those are able to maintain these kinds of working conditions is because we still buy from them. And it's for the reasons like you said, these large companies know what they're doing in advertisements and other marketing strategies. I agree with you that "The True Cost" is one of the most horrifying films I have ever seen. And I hope more people watch it outside of this class because it touches on a culture very relevant to us, especially being in the united states, consumerism.

<br><hr>
I also see greed as a huge component in the climate crisis. However, I did not realize how much the fashion industry also attributed to this greed. What I really find interesting as well is the action of selling ideals. Product fetishes have been have been built into our society as normal and yes, as much as we try to avoid the commercials and advertisements companies throw in our face, they can be really intriguing. These physiological tricks work on me and I actively go along with them (sometimes) because they provide me with a sense of pleasure, though this mainly pertains to food.
    <br><br>
For some reason I feel like people do not care enough about this manipulation and will go along with as I do because it sort of seems American to do so. It is well within someones right to advertise something as they want and create their own meaning behind a product even if the realities behind its production are morbid. We still buy it knowingly beaches it is cheap and our inherent individualism justifies our purchases.
<br><hr>
I totally agree with your comment that the majority of stuff we have learned about in this class links the climate crisis with greed. You also made some great points about how we could make changes if it weren't for the people in power and the way they manipulate the public for their own monetary benefit. However, this is a problem that I think is rooted even deeper in human existence and culture. Everything in this world revolves around money. The people who created these companies came into this industry for one thing and that was money. They aren't in this business to help and provide for people they are strictly concerned about money. This is just apart of our culture. We go to college to get educated and try to figure out how to make money in this world so we can keep up with all the consumption that has become necessary to fit into normal society. In the end its all about the money. In fact it becomes so much about the money that people develop extreme greed and attempt to make more and more money as efficiently as possible. We have to live in a society that is driven by a currency but we don't need to become greedy and loose sight of our morals in this process. These large companies shouldn't be exploiting people who don't have another option just to make more money. They can make enough without exploitation. 
    <br><br>

I also want to voice my opinion about who's fault it is that we continue to consume more and more. I think both sides are definitely to blame, however, we as consumers are to blame for the most part, especially when it comes to clothing. You don't need a lot of clothes. All you need a couple outfits that contain essential items of clothing. Yet, people continue to buy more and more clothing because they want to be fashionable and look good. As a society we need to move past this construct that it is cool to have fashion and buy new stuff all the time. We need to reconstruct this idea and make it cool to save the planet and be environmentally aware of our actions. 
    <br><br>

One fact that really stood out to me in this film, which you also pointed out in your comment, was that 250,000 cotton farmers have killed themselves in the last fifteen years. Read that again and then decide if your new blue cotton t-shirt is really worth it.
<br><hr>
I am in 100% agreement with you on the fact that sweatshops are one of the most disgusting things. Living, breathing people are indeed treated like they're not even human in order to capitalize on cheap labor to fund a world where greed is one of the main influencers in our society. The saddest thing about it all is that consumers in first-world countries don’t even bat an eye when buying a new product that was produced in a sweatshop. Especially in America, people are oblivious to what people have to go through in order for them to get a cheap five or ten dollar shirt at a reduced price and it’s honestly disappointing. I believe if sweatshops were closer to home and were more relevant in the United States, there would be more uproar when it came to the obvious abuse of innocent people who were forced to work in these shops. Because these sweatshops are more or less usually on the other side of the planet, the idea of abusing the less fortunate fuels big corporations and takes a backseat in the minds of consumers.

<br><hr>
Reading your comment really put words to the disgust in my head. I always pose the question of whether or not humans are inherently good people or inherently bad people. Having watched The True Cost, I can without a doubt objectively state that there are a lot of bad people in the world. What really digs beneath the surface for me is that we as ordinary consumers are, day in and day out, endorsing those very bad people. What instigated this thought was the clip of the collapse of the factory building, killing an absurd amount of workers. However, those workers weren't just ordinary blue-collar workers but rather these workers were forced to work in extremely inhumane conditions while being significantly underpaid. How is this fair? Going back to my previous statement, of how we are endorsing these cruel people, Phil Knight and Nike can be strongly likened to this statement. Growing up, I was always such a big fan of Nike, whether it be their tees or their very comfortable shoes or their wristbands, I wanted it. A few months back I was reading an article on Phil Knight (founder of Nike) and much to my surprise he and Nike were under great scrutiny for their poor treatment of "sweatshop workers". I was absolutely disgusted.  What further disgusted me was the fact that for the longest time I was such a big supporter of this corporate giant, only for this corporate giant to be a big supporter of cruelness. From this, it is very easy to see how powerful people/firms are able to get away with things they shouldn't be getting away from. The True Cost is a great medium for people to see this.

This film was definitely effective through intact contents. It combines many injuries, deaths, poor working conditions in slums and environmental pollutions. Those workers’ words showed that how unjust their experiences were-- just because they were born in developing countries, they have to working day and night at the cost of almost their lives being paid only “$10 a month”. With quotes from different occupations on behalf of different perspectives, this film illustrated the cruel truth in clothing industry.

    <br><br>

Poor economical conditions, terrible environment and exploitations in third world countries have been displayed very well which made this movie compelling to casual viewers as well. This group of people had less concerns about this issue in the past, but they were shocked and come to make a difference.

    <br><br>

 After watching this video, its emotional expression including tears and report of shouts, guns, etc. hit my mind. Those people in third world countries and foreign people who realized this outcome thought it was unfair to have such a benefit distribution for local makers and ecological environment. Also, their health is effected by the chemicals left in “millions of acres”. But several capitalists took it for granted to have a large amount of profits by running this transaction, instead, they considered they were saving those workers from worse living standards and working conditions, lower wages because “there are a lot worse things that they can be doing”, which is badly selfish.  From my perspective, terrible sweatshops are literally caused by those business men who making a lot of money by grinding the faces of the poor.

    <br><br>

 This movie pricks a bubble related to my imagination towards fashion. I learned about real responds of workers in factories, so I had a new perspective of clothes I wear. I feel pessimistic that I cannot do something to save those people in sweatshops now but I believe that this film’s audience would work together for workers’ better life.
    <br><br>


 I would like to rate this movie 5 stars because of its meaningful contents and I will recommend it to my friends so that we are able to find better solution in the future.

When approaching a sensitive topic such as fast fashion, many people will not react well with researchers or documentaries shoving hard cold facts down their throats, especially if these facts are directly the results of the actions that the audiences have participated in. However, by introducing such a topic through the use of humor, Hasan Minhaj successfully grabs the attention of the audiences, allowing them to listen without the the feeling of immense guilt and bitterness. Through the Patriot Act, I learned the term "greenwashing". I had always suspected that fast fashion companies such as H&M were still still playing dirty even after adopting the term "environmentally conscious" into their brand. I mean, how is it possible that despite introducing a new environmentally conscious line, Conscious, H&M is still able to maintain their low prices? It simply is not. I am truly disappointed that these big fast fashion brands think that all consumers are dumb and will take anything they say at face value. I also think the government from the developed nations that these unethical brands are from should establish regulations to reinforce ethical employment as well as introduce heavy taxation on mass production and pollution. I understand that the government of the underdeveloped nations whose citizens are being thoroughly exploited don't have much incentive to stop their people from working in sweatshops or assembly lines, because although the exploitation is clear, maybe these sweatshops offer a better pay than local jobs, as sad as it sounds. However, when a country's own citizens are being poisoned as a result of the byproducts of producing fast fashion and the government still turns a blind eye, then I have to ask, what is the purpose of the government?

The film “The True Cost” does an excellent job of depicting the stark contrast between the society that consumes, and the society that makes consumption possible. In its analysis of the fashion industry, it exposes the deep flaws and extremely hazardous processes that are involved in the production of clothing. This movie hits every possible effect of the fashion industry from inhumane factory conditions, to rising health conditions from pesticides, to a receding middle class. The creators expertly prove their suggestion that as consumers, we need to do a much better job at taking into account the true cost of what we’re buying, rather than just taking it at the price tag. The culture of consumption that’s been created in our society is poisonous to human rights, safe working conditions, environmental awareness, and our own psychological state. 
    <br><br>
 The big fashion companies of today have solely gained their profit off of the back-breaking work of workers in third-world countries. As the most labor dependent industry in the world, the fashion industry employs one out of six people. This might seem like a satisfying statistic to know that it provides a multitude of jobs for people, but it’s actually a terrifying fact when you take into account that most of those employed by this industry are suffering in barbaric and unsafe conditions. Near the capital of Bangladesh, an eight-story clothing production building collapsed, killing nearly 1,000 people in the process. What makes the Rana Plaza Disaster so problematic is that the workers repeatedly informed their supervisors of cracks in the wall and the faulty structure of the building, but the supervisors locked the doors and forced the workers to continue production. This type of treatment would cause complete outrage if it were done in a factory in the United States, but since big brand clothing companies outsource their factory work to third world countries, there’s no one to fight for better conditions for them. When some of the workers attempted to form a union and send in a request for a change to be brought about, they were cruelly beaten and forced to work even longer hours with less pay. This only exemplifies one of the hidden costs of clothing. This type of treatment is cruel and made me sick to think that I have been a part of a culture that’s propagating this type of hurt onto others. As consumers, hearing this should make it obvious that the clothes we buy and the companies we naively give our money to are simply forcing these social injustices to occur. The only way to reconcile the fast fashion process, that we forced with our own spending habits, is to reevaluate the culture of consumption that we surrendered to a long time ago.

While I knew the majority of the problems with the fast fashion movement, it was a whole different experience having to look into the eyes and hear the voices of the biggest victims of it, the people working to build all this stuff. The image that I found especially disturbing was the girls on youtube buying all this clothes - most of which looked like junk that would be out of fashion the day they bought it - against the backdrop of the poor and suffering workers. One of the girls in the youtube videos even said "I don't really know why I bought it", referring to a piece of clothing she had just bought. 
    <br><br>

These girls all seemed completely brainwashed. Looking at them and hearing there words it seems to me that they have strayed from the nature of being a human being. They do not seem to be in touch with reality, as if they lost there way. Unfortunately this is the result of our innovation, we have gone so far way from nature and the natural tendency of animals, that we do not really know how to manage the abundance that the world we have built makes accessible to us. We are obsessed with pinging our brains with pleasure hormones by buying and buying, and it just seems like we have become alienated from what a real human should be. In many ways, humans have lost their humanity. This comes into stark contrast with Walden's book, in which even back then at the start of the capitalist movement predicted these issues and tried to introduce a more human way of life...


<br><hr>
I agree with you and the fact that we must reevaluate our consumer culture. It is our individual responsibility to recognize our impact when we buy a piece of clothing. We must realize the corruption that is a result of our consumption. After watching this documentary, I was left numb by what I had seen. I was disgusted with the fact that so many of us are left in the dark about what is really behind everything we consume. I think what hit me the hardest was the fact the people at the top of the companies making all the profit are aware of the environmental damage as well as the damage of so many lives in third world countries abroad, yet they continue to dig a deeper hole. I was unaware of the fact that most of our cotton is genetically modified and was also unaware of the serious health detriments caused by farming with the harsh pesticides as well as living close to the factories. There are so many detrimental factors that play into the process of fast fashion and that are hidden in the cheap prices and endless amount of options on the shelf. The large corporations have brainwashed society into consumer robots. We live each day ready to buy the next best thing, throw it away, and buy its replacement. It’s a vicious cycle that is not only degrading our earth but degrading and chipping away at the lives of marginalized workers over-seas. We need to wake up and stop feeding into the corrupt industry.

I really liked the way that Hasan Minhaj presents the problem of fast fashion. He used comedy to keep the audience engaged and he has a fairly large following that allows this topic to reach a wide audience. One thing that stuck out to me was when he joked about how you feel the need to have different outfits all the time to keep up appearances on instagram. I think that it is really important to note the influence of social media on consumerism. As Ken mentions, once people gain large followings on forms of social media like Youtube and Instagram, they can monetize this through advertising on social media. Thus, social media both causes us to want to buy more to show off and causes us to constantly be bombarded by advertisements from people who many look up to and want to be like. 
    <br><br>

I was really surprised by the fact that the effects of fast fashion are more harmful to the environment than both flights and maritime shipping. I had thought that airplanes were essentially the worst thing that has happened to the environment, so I did not expect that the fast fashion industry could have an even greater effect. Minhaj did a really good job of going over how the manufacturing of each type of fabric is detrimental to the environment and reinforces this by adding how giving away clothes is just as problematic. 
    <br><br>

Minhaj was also effective in making it clear to the audience that he is well educated on the topic and did extensive research. While talking about "greenwashing", he highlights that companies manipulate people in their reports to seem like they are much more environmentally friendly and hiding information that proves otherwise. This exemplifies the need for the public to do more of their own research to see what companies are truly environmentally sustainable, rather than falling into the trap of well-made advertisements that are making false and misleading claims. 
    <br><br>

I think that his comedic style to introducing important topics is a really good idea. A lot of comedians use politics in their acts to make jokes while criticizing different policies or people, and I actually have learned a lot about politics from watching comedy. For example, SNL includes a lot of political skits. If more comedians and popular shows talk about the climate crisis, then a much larger audience will be more informed.

When I saw the documentary, I was shocked. In this documentary, I see the oppression of the poor by the powerful. The documentary introduces the world's lowest-paid garment workers, whose wages are only three dollars a day. And because of the constant price reduction of commodities, the working conditions of these workers are getting worse and worse, even the collapse of factories and fire, leading to the death of thousands of people, thus making the life of these workers more difficult. Later, the documentary also mentioned that farmers are often forced to buy seeds at high prices, and large-scale use of pesticides, which pollutes the soil and water sources in India, causing mental and physical congenital defects of local residents and many people suffering from skin diseases. I believe that after watching this documentary, our consumption concept will be greatly improved. It is not only for personal interests, but also to protect the rights and interests of these workers, and also to protect the earth's environment.

This film had many statistics that shocked me. While i knew the fast fashion industry was detrimental to our environment, I did not know to what extent they were so. In fact, I didn’t even know which companies were considered to be fast fashion companies. For example, a big company Hasan repeatedly talked about was Zara. Before watching this Zara, I always considered Zara to be more of an expensive brand, and assumed they weren’t part of the fast fashion industry. Of course, it could be because I don’t shop there often, but I never understood Zara to be part of the fast fashion industry. It shocked me that they used such extreme methods such as quick response manufacturing and dynamic assortment to attract customers and urge them to buy more. The idea behind green washing also sickened me as Hasan revealed the manipulative ways companies used to make themselves seem more green than they really were. H&M’s “recycling” was particularly shocking as it did not only market them as eco-friendly and green when they weren’t, it also encouraged people to buy more clothing from their store. I was also unaware at the large amounts of natural resources that go into producing the various fabrics used in clothing. 
     <br><br>
I was even more shocked to hear about the drastically short amount of time people are using their clothes and how much people buy. In the film, it was stated that an average American buys around 68 pieces of clothing per year. I don’t think that is necessary at all. I am someone who really enjoys shopping, but after hearing all these statistics, I feel very discouraged from shopping in retail stores ever again. This is where the idea of thrift stores and buying secondhand clothing comes into play. According to the film, buying just one piece of used clothing instead of a new piece of clothing could save 6 lbs of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, which is equivalent to removing half a million cars from roads for a whole year. This is mind boggling to me, and it goes to show how a small action we take could impact the world so greatly. After watching this video, I am determined to buy most if not all of my clothing from thrift stores from now on and wear my clothes for as long as I possibly can.

"True Cost" is yet another example of how nuanced and dynamic environmental studies is. This film successfully interconnects social justice and environmental impact. It displays in harsh and true colors how important environmental justice is. Not only does the fast fashion industry produce hundreds of thousands of liters of toxic waste water, but it also destroys lives, disables children, and disregards fair pay to hardworking people in third world countries. A general American citizen's pride in buying a "super cute $8 shirt" is at the expense of not only someone working in horrible conditions, but also destroying the planet. I think that this topic is severely overlooked. I found many of the facts in this film super surprising. I had no idea that many of the used clothing donated to charity go to waste and eventually pollute. A potential solvent to this problem could be more local clothing drives or swaps. Keeping a local eye on everything, from food production to clothing disposal, can help secure that your impact is as small as it is portrayed to be through advertising and media.

Hasan's "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" was a great presentation on the wide misinformation we are given from producers who only have the priority of profit in mind. I found it very disturbing at how much companies take effort in creating an image to the public.They try their best in making advertisements and creating new lines that are supposedly "eco-friendly" when in reality they are trying to fabricate vague statements that make a false facade of their consciousness of the environmental detriment their fast production is creating. I felt that Hasan effectively addressed the question of how we as consumers should do our part in limiting our harm to an already dying planet. We cannot rely on the assumption that companies are tailoring to our needs and concerns, we have to consume less and make purchases that are more towards necessity not excess. We cannot take any information at face value, even though we may want to believe it in order to feel better about the fast fashion craze most of us are participating in. It is an undeniable fact that companies are about business, so any method that can ensure steady customers, companies will take the advantage. I felt like Hasan's video made me reconsider the importance of realizing self-responsibility. If producers are not going to make changes, that does not mean the consumers have to go along with it either.

I think that the film was very effective at communicating its subject. The film shows the answer to “what is the true cost behind those beautiful clothes?” It communicates its subject by using different resources, such as interviews a lot of people work in fast fashion to tell their stories and their opinions about the clothing industry. This film shows the dark side of the clothing industry by interviewing those people who suffer from it, such as poor working conditions and a huge amount of work of the workers and low wages that happened in India. Also, this film shows images, videos, and facts to tell us that cheap labor has been severely exploited. People already concerned about the issue or casual viewers? In my perspective, I think the film’s audience should be casual viewers. The film clips a large number of avid consumers who buy clothes at affordable stores such as H&M, ZARA, and Forever 21. Use this to compare to the interviews with the cheap labor that makes clothes and awaken people's sympathy. For example, most people in the village have cancer because of industrial pollution. The child is lying on the bed, and the mother can only sit next to him waiting for death. The collapse of the factory has taken away countless young lives. The crying of their family members in the video evokes people's sympathy and allows them to learn to be rational when consuming. I feel sad about the labor experience. They do a huge amount of work but only can get $2 a month. When they stand up and fight for their rights, the government not protect them but hurt them by using stick and guns to beat and kill them. But I am also thinking rationally about the question “what cause this happens?” The economy developed at a fast speed, and people's power of consumption also developed. People like to use the money they earn to buy all kinds of branded things or cheap things, but if they buy, it will become worthless. But for the rich people, they use the money they earn to buy things that are more valuable, such as houses, precious metals, and re-production of enterprises. They enjoy high-end medical education and benefit their descendants. So richer people have more money, and the poor people, still penniless. For the middle class, they almost disappear. The so-called rapid economic development, the enormous richness of material life is such a huge scam, it just plunder and transfer of real wealth. I do learn a lot from the film. I never paid attention to think about the chain business about fast fashion and never thought that there would be such a dark side behind fashion. This film did not change my attitude toward fast fashion, because I never spend my interest in clothing. But I fell a little pessimistic after watching the film because this problem becomes more serious now. At 00:00 on November 11, 2019, the Tmall Global Carnival (similar to Black Friday) opened, and the turnover exceeded RMB 10 billion in only 96 seconds, 29 seconds less than in 2018. By 0:12:49, Tmall's turnover exceeded 50 billion yuan. Impulsive consumption seems hard to change when those companies have a great discount.

After watching the Patriot Act episode “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion,” I was most upset by the continuing trend of developed countries ruining the lives of millions of people in the developing world through our thoughtless actions. For example, the fact that the fast fashion industry is able to poison entire rivers in Indonesia for the sole purpose of making a profit is unthinkable. Wealthy businesses often exploit developing nations for their cheap labor and lenient manufacturing laws, which ultimately acts as a way of literally dumping our problems onto others. Children who play no part in adding to the climate crisis should not have to get sick because of our destructive shopping habits. How did we get to a point of buying 68 new pieces of clothing every year? We as consumers play a huge role in the industry. Buying less new clothes and opting for second-hand pieces results in a decreased demand for fast fashion. By decreasing the demand, the supply should follow. I agree with Hasan Minhaj’s point about social media being an influential factor in the industry, as many people find the need to buy a new outfit every time they post without spending too much money. Solving this problem would require a shift in our culture, making it normal to rewear outfits and choosing pieces of quality over quantity. I also find Hasan's platform and filming of shorter episodes to be effective, especially if viewers are curious about a particular issue but do not have the time to watch hour-long documentaries. His videos almost act as a crash course, where people can then do their own further research if they find the content interesting.

Your comment kinda reminds me of the astonishing fact that 5% of the world is contributing a quarter of the total carbon emission in the world. This is exactly what the Indian lady in Decaprio's documentary said-- that it is impossible for the poorest countries to focus on environmental protection when a majority of its population is still struggling with basic needs in life. This makes me wonder what are the true causes of the suffering of third world country garment workers and all these social & environmental catastrophes. The answer is pretty much answered in "The True Cost"---Consumerism or Capitalism in the world's most developed countries. Although we had such morality to not build our happiness at the expense of others' suffering, the fashion industry along with many industries that produce overly desired consumer goods are indeed making profits on the basis of poor workers' daily suffering. At this point, the problem is not solely with the sustainability of our planet, but it is instead a deep self-assessment of our deep moral ground. And sadly even if this ugly truth is apparent and intense enough for uneducated workers to rebel, people in the "ivory tower" are still arguing in defense of this flawed morality of human beings. 

     <br><br>

Though I am not wishing to put this problem as a class conflict, what is indicated in "The True Cost" definitely reveals some of the most deeply rooted, and utterly immoral rules of our society. And we could expect the conflicts to intensify with a globalized economy and development.

I agree that the Patriot Act episode was very effective in getting the message across to the general public. Not only did I learn a lot--like the insane amount (18 tons) of donated clothing that collects every 3 days in a single Salvation Army center in New York--but I also really enjoyed watching the episode. When I watch documentaries, they are usually just informative and depressing. But after I watched this episode, I was tempted to binge-watch the rest of the episodes on Netflix. If there were more similarly formatted films or shows, I would definitely watch them more often. I definitely agree that the time-difference also makes a big difference. It would be way easier to convince my friends and family to watch these episodes, as opposed to typical documentaries. I already told my dad and a friend about it!
<br><hr>
Even though this a problem people may not think about, when it’s explained to you it makes a lot of sense. Fast fashion is such a big trend and people do really care about how their fashion looks, so it makes sense that people are buying so many new clothing pieces per year. I thought Hasan Minhaj’s episode was really good because it brought attention the cost behind these widespread trends. It’s pretty sad that we’re at a point where people don’t think they can wear outfits more than once without sacrificing some kind of social status. I think we really have to change that culture and make it more widespread to just get pieces that you really like or thrift shop. Even though people really like fashion, it just isn’t sustainable to keep these habits.
     <br><br>


Another thing that really surprised me was how the fast fashion companies are greenwashing themselves. It was really disappointing, although funny, to see Hasan tell people what the clothes really were but people still liked them. I think the way that the Patriot Act goes about these social awareness campaigns is really effective. People already like Hasan Minhaj, so they’ll watch his show because it’s funny, but it also includes really important information that is good for people to know. This way, it leads people to watching this kind of informational things when they may not be people who would watch documentaries or seek out this information.


<br><hr>
I agree with you in that I find The Patriot Act episode to be quite effective in that it was short, funny, and super loaded with information packed in a few punchlines. I think it draws people in and gets them interested in these issues, and after they’re done laughing, chances are they’ll go home and ruminate on the things they’ve learned and reconsider their lifestyle. Whereas if you show someone a super depressing documentary or the Wallace Wells article, they might leave thinking “Oh it’s too late now, we are all doomed and there’s nothing I can do.
     <br><br>

I also find the fact that the fast fashion industry is poisoning local rivers and getting children sick is extremely revolting. This is a crime and nothing is being done because these are powerful corporations with probably 20 lawyers protecting them by finding loopholes in the law/system. Sound similar enough.
     <br><br>

It’s really funny how as soon as people become aware of this issue, these companies scramble to salvage their image. Zara really thinks that they can throw some model, a farm, some cattles into a video and suddenly they’re now sustainable and eco friendly. And what about the reduced water in the dying process, while the dying only constitutes 1% of the garment production? It was eye opening and mind boggling to me that these companies try to lie and manipulate consumers like we’re are stupid, and to be hoenst, we might as well be if we continue to be so oblivious to their unethical practices and their tactics.

<br><hr>

The one quote that jumped out at me from "The Patriot Act" episode was, "textile production created more greenhouse gases than international flights and maritime shipping combined". That’s insane. Last year when I took ENGL 22 with Hiltner, I watched "The True Cost" and I found out about all the terrible working conditions and dangers that come from fast fashion. These topics bring back what we have learned in the past few weeks about how developed countries like the U.S. are putting all this CO2 into the atmosphere and the developing countries like India are suffering the consequences when they don’t have the money or infrastructure to handle any of it. 
     <br><br>

When we go to H&M and get inexpensive clothes we aren't thinking about all the greenhouse gas emissions and we aren't thinking about the young women and children in third world countries who are working in unsafe factories in order to make these clothes. It’s plain and simple. It’s exploitation. The poorest countries on earth cannot focus on environmental problems, because they’re focused on making enough money to survive and support their families. It also reminds me of how important it is to buy your foods locally, and I think we can incorporate that same mentality into clothes. Buy from local thrift stores!! And furthermore we need to all in all consume less. Minimalism might work for some people, but it is a little extreme. Watching something like this short episode on the effects of fast fashion is so simple and should spread to people all over the developed world in order to open our eyes to reality.

This documentary is really necessary. The free-market economy takes a big part of all of the developed countries. Until today, the free-market economy is the most efficient economic system. The capital always pursuit the profit in the free-market economy. The consensus and moral standard is the best way to limit regardless of capital. However, the effect of this may be limited. 

     <br><br>

The desire for possession is the most common desire of humans, as well as the desire for compare. The fast-fashion smartly takes advantage of the human's desire, or weakness, to make people obsession in the thing they afford. However, similar to the drug, the satisfaction only maintain in a short period. The fast-fashion business certainly generates more negative influence than positive influence.

After watching “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion,” it opened my eyes about consumer culture and the fast fashion demand. The statistics in this video were mind blowing and honestly terrifying. The eas, accessibility, and cheap price of quick fashion through websites such as Zara and H&M make it almost irresistible to not purchase something. I agree with your comment about how the satisfaction of purchasing a lot of material possessions only lasts for a short amount of time. People will chase the high of getting new clothing even if it only fulfills them for a split second. The sad part is that when we get all of these new packages in the mail, we do not realize the amount of waste that is produced from clothing. Some of the statistics presented to us in this video were unbelievable. The fact that it takes that many gallons of water to produce one piece of clothing and how almost all of it is made of plastic is something that everyone needs to be aware of. The fast fashion industry is causing way more harm than help.

This maybe a sensitive topic because many of us may enjoy the pleasure of buying new clothes, whether they are expensive or cheap, so suggest directly buying less clothes maybe controversial. However, people do need to buy less clothes, because of the chain effect behind this. Workers may get injured in the factory. They did not receive satisfying treatment. People are sick because of the pesticides put on the material of clothes----vegetation. Consumers throw away their old clothes, which will pollute the environment (river). Thus, this is not only about protecting the environment, this is also about protecting people.

What has this film done? What has it done for the countries it has exposed? What has the workers gained from this film? Has it donated all their profit from this film to the people it was filming? Or is this another way of exploiting labor, exploiting people and their struggles? Nothing. I can find nothing from their site (https://truecostmovie.com/about/) saying anything. Taking advantage of people's lives and how much they are trying to fight back. This is just like Steve McCurry when he exploited Sharbat Gula and her appearance. He didn't ask for her consent when he took her picture, he asked the teacher (male-identifying) for consent. His picture of her traveled the world (without Gula's knowledge) and has been determined as one of the best Nat Geo covers (very problematic) ever in Nat Geo history. McCurry taken the copyrights of HER photo and earned millions of dollars off of this and kept it all. He didn't ask for her story, he didn't ask for her name, he didn't ask how he can help, he didn't use his PROFITS to aid this now-lady, sick and separated from her family after having sat in prison for fighting for her life. HAS Andrew Morgan and his colleagues asked for consent from these womxn and workers before he entered their world to film them? Is there still that "white savior" mentality that he can't bear to let go? But did he actually help anyone????????????????
      <br><br>

Yes thank you for bringing this issue to light. Thank you for telling people about it. What has Andrew Morgan done for the people he filmed besides creating a horror story for an audience too privileged to realize their position, too arrogant to care for human rights, too pretentious to actually know what is happening in this world? For an audience obsessed with power and will continuously push other people down to just standing on top of bodies after bodies. For an audience that, after watching this, will ALWAYS say "third world" and "developing" countries instead of just countries because they enjoy dehumanizing others so it's easier to pollute their land, disrespect their religion, and violate their health and livelihood. 
      <br><br>

Climate Crisis stems from inequality, abuse, and RACISM. IF we can see all human beings as living things, all animals as living things, then just maybe, we can be a little more conscious and live with a little more purpose. This documentary disgusts me because the call to action is passive. "Just stop buying things." NO. 
     <br><br>
THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. HOW just HOW can you end with that with everything you've just filmed and covered?????????
     <br><br>
 
As Vandana says, "we need to recognize that capital is just money. Money is means and people should be accountable for how it's used. We need to celebrate the creative power of human beings. We need to talk of creative work. We must stop talking about labor. We need to look at the land as not a commodity to be speculated and traded, but as the very basis of our life, as Mother Earth."

"The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" episode to me was a perfect way of communicating a very important topic about the climate crisis. I found myself laughing hysterically at some of his points but still very informed after about the horrific facts of the fast-fashion industry. I thought it was interesting using a comedian to communicate such a serious and important subject but it works well using familiar or inviting individuals to communicate divisive topics because it creates a comfortable environment that listeners are willing to listen to factual and convincing evidence. Whereas if you were to use a scientist or radically passionate person because there is a stigma these people typically alarmists overreacting so they aren't willing to listen to anything they say versus familiar inviting individuals are easier to trust which leads to more successful communication.
     <br><br>

 Besides the very well delivered episode, something that surprised me was when the host disproved all the recycled clothing. I 'honestly have boughten certain clothes over others based on the fact that they were boasting they were made from recycled materials. If I had known that it is typically only 10% or so actually recycled I would bought used clothes instead. The blatantly obvious misinformative and economic gain hungry fashion industry companies H&M and Zara draw stark comparisons to the oil industry and the same corrupt and environmentally damaging practices they do. Both industries are accounting for insane amounts of emissions and are thriving and operating solely off of our dependency and addiction to these industries. While these industries are responsible for all the damage being caused and for keeping their practices going I feel it is our responsibility to stop these industries since they depend on us. We don't have to stop buying clothes or driving cars we just need to lessen our addiction. In the matter of my generation, we were able to make smoking cigarettes not cool and significantly decrease the number of smokers and wean our addiction. So it's possible to wean our addiction to these industries it's just a matter of a large enough movement being sparked and people taking action.

My first thought after watching The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion was “I need to show this to my mom.” Try as I might, I simply can’t get my mother to care much about our family’s impact on the planet, and what she can do about it. She’s a big fan of shopping online, and I see package after package of new clothes come to our doorstep each month. But this, she might be able to get on board with. I completely agree with your opinion that learning about concerning topics like this are made much more comfortable through humor, and I believe that Hasan Minhaj did an excellent job balancing jokes with information in this episode.
      <br><br>
I especially enjoyed the focus on greenwashing, how many brands try to improve their image and gain consciously-minded customers by launching lines that appear to be “sustainable or eco-friendly.” I rolled my eyes at some of the ridiculous attempts made by brands, such as “made with the most sustainably produced polyurethane” (an oxymoron) and “real wool content” (meaning 4%). Again, I felt that this was something my mom really needed to hear. Although she hasn’t been willing to make many lifestyle changes herself, she knows that I’ve been making changes to live more sustainably, and I’ve gotten a lot of texts from her recently along the lines of “Look! Brand X has this eco-friendly line now, aren’t you into that stuff?” This episode explains the concept of greenwashing really well, so that more consumers like my mom will know what to avoid when shopping.

The film "The True Cost" tells such a sad story. So much of what happens in the lives of these people is driven by companies looking for the best way to make the most profit. They turn a blind eye to safety regulations being ignored and corners to be cut. The workers in Bangladesh risk their lives for less money a day that most US workers make in minutes. It was so sad to see the footage of those in Dakah that were in the building that collapsed, both those that were killed by the building and those that survived to see either their coworkers killed or to have been physically injured in the disaster. Others have been killed while protesting for decent living conditions.
      <br><br>


The cotton farmer also had a sad story. Her husband got brain cancer and died at the age of 50, most likely because of the pesticides being used around their living area. 50 is such a young age to die at. What makes it sadder is that this was not an isolated incident. There is a very skilled brain surgeon in their area (not a coincidence) who has seen many cases similar to her husband's.

      <br><br>

All of this sadness for extra money on the table for the richest companies around. Companies that build their audience to want more and more from said companies. It is not the consumers' fault though. The companies design advertisements that mess with our psychology, make us want it, make us into their puppets, so that we buy more. We fuel the demand for these clothes that are made by people with horrible living conditions. That causes them to have to continue to work, often at even lower wages and worse conditions, as the clothing companies seek to sell even more by lowering their costs. We need to stop fueling this horrendous monster of fashion.

This film was really depressing to be honest. Something that really angered me was when the white guy (I forgot his name) was talking about how sweatshops are "essential" in capitalism in order for countries to develop. I was left thinking ???? Overworking, underpaying, and subjecting people to horrific work conditions and unrealistic production standards should not be "essential" to capitalism. I hate the argument that we need to make sacrifices like that for the benefit of the economy. It's so stupid. I'm sorry I'm being rather blunt, but those sorts of arguments are absolutely ridiculous. 
      <br><br>
It was so sad to see the conditions that the fashion industry has created for workers in other countries--and they take no accountability for it whatsoever because they technically aren't the ones contracting those people. These companies will really go to extreme measures to squeeze out as much profit as possible from any part of the manufacturing process--from the agricultural part of it to production to selling. I haven't read any comments, so I could be wrong, but I think people will respond with "consumers have to stop buying from these companies and they'll change their ways." But (I mentioned this in my other comment too) to an extent it really isn't the fault of the consumer. It was mentioned in the film that the media will create a culture of high materialistic value to stuff, to clothing, which makes people more anxious/depressed and, consequently, makes them more susceptible to media ads. It's basically propaganda, with the idea that one's needs will be satisfied by consumption. 
      <br><br>
Companies are exploiting people's labor, sometimes costing them their lives, because they are simply trying to survive and they are simultaneously feeding on and worsening the insecurities of consumers to create more profit. 
      <br><br>
Where does it end? At what point will these companies realize what they are doing is wrong and stop thinking about only profit? Sure, there are voluntary codes of conduct but the moment the possibility of laws to regulate these companies arises, they do everything they can to prevent them from passing. I guess in that sense they already realize what they are doing is wrong but refuse to acknowledge it. 
      <br><br>
At the end of the film someone said "deal with the system or your not serious" and that resonated very heavily with me. it's true any solution that doesn't address the issue at its very root, will not work. Any solution to the climate crisis, to economic injustices, and injustice will fail if it does not change the system.

I came into this film with a unique perspective. I am relatively active on social media and the discussion of fast fashion and shaming multinational corporations rise again every once in a while. After one occasion of this, I talked to my mom and said how there’s so many companies that we should boycott because of their exploitation of children as low-paid workers. My mom brought up the point that these children may want to work to help their families and laws ruling against this would ruin the family’s chance of survival. I was taken aback at this revelation and had to reflect on it. My mom grew up in the Philippines, a third world developing country, and through this comment, may be elaborating on how she would try to make side money and how every cent mattered in her household. I do see why in poorer countries, minors would be interested in working at such a young age, but this does diminish the fact that sweatshops provide low wages, unsafe conditions, and factory disasters. There is no alternative for them. Of course with their innocence and pure hearts, children would want to assist their families. It is the structure of our society that is so horrid that has us considering that it’s at least good for the youth to be hired for work because it is in the goodness of their heart they want to help when in actuality, this is such a sad thing to expect. Not only should our world’s structure allow kids to be kids, but workplaces should be fair and give wages that individuals can live off of.
      <br><br>

These factories are super hot filled with chemicals, not very safe for anyone especially vulnerable children. Shima, for example, pointed this out and will send her daughter to get raised by other friends and family outside of the city and will only see her once or twice a year. This is one of the many consequences that people must suffer in order to afford a living. It affects those trying to make a living -- one farmer every 30 minutes commits suicide, that is insane -- to even the consumers are psychologically affected, believing materialism will lead to happiness if we have more things. Fast fashion has such a negative impact socially and in the lens of this class, environmentally. The average American throws away 82 pounds of textile waste each year, adding up to 11 million tons of textile waste from U.S. Non-biodegradable sits in landfills for 200+ years and releasing harmful gases in the air. Water is contaminated with chemicals like chromium, leading for produce to get affected and to health problems of others. 
      <br><br>

H&M declining to make a statement for this film speaks volumes. They can’t even defend themselves; they cannot honestly state their business exploits people and neglects the environment. Making a change stands for the world and for its inhabitants. Too many problems in this world are ignored by turning a blind eye. People need to stop being so selfish, especially the wealthy whose net worth is so wealthy that a percentage of it may overturn a lot of our man-made disasters! This class has taught me that humans who lack human decency are fueling social injustice and the deterioration of our common home. We do not just need to make cultural changes, but people need a change of heart. Stop thinking of the growth of your bank account and look at the numbers of the people exploited, hurting, dying.

Watching "The True Cost" was absolutely heartbreaking. The amount of damage that is being done to developing countries because of the fashion industry is despicable and evil. The fact that we (the US) only make 3% of the clothing that we purchase is strange. The other 97% is delegated to poor countries like Cambodia and Bangladesh where workers are paid just a few dollars per day. Not only are these workers paid next to nothing, but they face deplorable and deadly working conditions every day. How is it possible that someone may die during their work day? The Rana Plaza massacre that happened in Bangladesh should never have happened. It is unbelievable that the owners of the factory ignored the terrible state of the building simply to continue making clothing at a fast rate; over 1,000 people died in this disaster. Moreover, around 250,000 cotton farmers in India die of suicide annually because of the horrid conditions of farm life. They are forced to use pesticides on their cotton farms that cause birth defects, cancer and other ailments. 
      <br><br>

On the other end of the fashion industry cycle, the average American throws out 82 pounds of clothing per year, which amounts to 11 million pounds annually in the US. The amount of waste this creates is detrimental to the environment and causes toxic chemicals to be released into the air. This is unacceptable. Why is it okay to ruin the environment and hundreds of thousands of people's lives just so we can buy cheap clothing? Why is a worker like Shima worth less than the average American consumer? 
      <br><br>

Change needs to be made to the system of the capitalist fashion industry before another Rana Plaza. No one wins in the current system -- except for these vile corporations.

The documentary was also very tough for me to watch. Like you said, the many women who died just so the companies can profit was tragic. Moreover, mothers having to leave their children to work is heartbreaking. Not only are they subjected to unsafe working conditions, they are also paid very little, yet the companies that are making millions don’t seem to care. When the workers demand fair wages, they get beaten by their employers and eventually return to their job because there are no other options. Valuing profit and productivity more than human lives is absurd.
       <br><br>

Another part of the documentary that surprised me was the impact of genetically modified cotton and pesticide use on farmers. The seed prices increased so much that farmers killed themselves because they lost their land. Additionally, the exposure to pesticides have caused cancer and birth defects. Like Thoreau stated, this is largely the fault of the companies. The woman from the Texas Organic Cotton Marketing Cooperative made a very interesting point on organic items. We eat organic food and believe we’re safe because we are not ingesting pesticides. However, clothing made of (nonorganic) cotton contain pesticides that directly touch our skin – the largest organ in humans. The growth of cotton and use of pesticides cause a chain of events, the workers who spray the pesticides are affected, workers sewing the clothes are affected, the people who wear those articles of clothing are affected, and the environment is affected. There’s the cost of polluting the environment, labor, poor working conditions, and many more, but they all connect to the harm done to people and the earth.

I could not watch this film in one sitting. It was incredibly frustrating, and just thinking about what I saw in the film is overwhelming with thoughts and leaves me speechless at the same time. Given that production of clothing in the US has gone down from 97% to 3% by the use of outsourcing to weaker economies creates a cultural ideal of “my clothes are cheap enough to throw away” without really thinking about it. As the U.S. demands lower costs from outsourced factories because of U.S. capitalistic competition, factories are either forced to shut down or cut corners. The examples of the latter choice are disastrous. The film said, “as death tolls rose, so did profitability.” That is clear dehumanization in the name of capitalism. As one interviewee from Bangladesh explains, it is necessary for ALL parties involved to take responsibility for this abuse and crimes, including the companies in the U.S. who demand such conditions for profit. The narratives of factory workers having worse options than garment factories like coal mining,  choosing to work in garment factories because it is not relatively dangerous, that garment industries globally will in time raise living standards and higher wages with the skills acquired, is completely atrocious (esp the lady who said it didn’t bother her that garment workers dedicated their whole lives to U.S./European profit). Seeing the effects of this fast fashion industry manifest into the intensification of agriculture and GMOs and advertising (really propaganda) and physical health, exemplifies how this is now an intersectional issue. I hope more movements like the Fair Trade movement become integrated into our dominant social culture. As MLK said, we need a “revolution on values” to stop treating people as profit.

In the documentary, the True Cost we explore the history of the fashion industry as a whole. The film makes a relevant connection to the fashion in Marie Antoinette’s aristocratic court, where fashion trends truly began to take shape. A person of high standing would have had a lavish gown with many jewels and fabrics, a pompous wig and makeup made from imported goods. Thus what you wore literally represented your socioeconomic background. I think connecting the modern fashion industry to French aristocratic fashion trends is smart because we as an audience know that the court’s extreme spending on luxury goods is what ultimately lead to their downfall during the French Revolution. While I’d argue that the idea of fashion and the beauty of clothes does positively impact the individual, the accelerated rate in which the industry now is producing cheap, mass produced clothes actually devalues the individual’s sense of being. Through fashion brands such as Zara, H&M, and Forever 21 we see an absolutely overwhelming variety of cheap clothes. As a young teenager I was always excited to visit these stores because each time I went I would see new clothes. Now this memory unsettles me because I wonder what happened to those mountains of clothes. I know for a fact it was not donated for no large fashion brand ever donated to the Humane Societies centers I worked in during high school. Something I also noted was since childhood there were the labels that read “Made in China” or “Made in Vietnam” in nearly everything I owned. I’d ask my parents why this was and they simply replied “It’s cheaper to make stuff there”. I took this for a fact and never gave it much thought, until I watched a documentary depicting the Dhaka garment factory collapse. I learned of the horrendous conditions in which poor workers (often women and children) in third world countries were being paid less than $80 - 200 a month. Health insurance and safety regulations were out of question. The only thing that mattered to the companies was … profit. It made me think back to those mountains of clothes that weren’t sold. Were they simply discarded in landfills? Unused and unwanted even if the process of their production involved the suffering of thousands of exploited laborers? The main blame for these tragedies is the overinflated Western countries’ desire for more. In the 1960’s 97% of American clothing came from US garment manufacturing now it is 3%. The remaining 97% comes from countries such as Indonesia, China, Vietnam and India. These countries and the US built an industry worth $3 trillion every year but safe working environments and health regulations are not the top priority. Why aren’t they able to guarantee these basic human rights when they are making so much profit? It is horrendous to see economists and supposedly educated people argue that sweatshops are good, because they generate more jobs and generate money for the economy. This is a disgusting mentality that people from privileged positions share, they think people in these textile sweatshops choose to live like this but the reality is that it’s not a choice. How could there have been a choice when there was no other alternative to begin with? It was  beautiful and sad to see that educated women from these developing countries are the only ones actively seeking to change this corrupt system.

I don't like to every blame other people or situations for MY actions. However, after the assignments this week-especially the reading-, I am so torn in deciding who's to blame: The industries or the consumers. Surely, each party has a part in the problem, But I never thought about giving away 100% ownership of my actions away until this week and when thinking about ads (especially in the fast-fashion industry). "The True Cost" was an exceptional documentary and one of my favorites from this course thus far. Seeing the working conditions of the women in Bangladesh brought tears to my eyes and made me kind of disgusted thinking about every time I purchased a cheap item of clothing, NEVER wondering where it came from. I was so sad for the women's working conditions and the impossibilities of them standing up to their employers.  While it is easy to cast these working conditions off as "developing countries' problems," it isn't that easy. In fact, Fashion Nova (a very popular fast-fashion industry here in the US) works out of Los Angeles. Recently, the New York Times and other news publications, found that the labor laws in these factories were not being met. Fashion Nova now owes billions of dollars to their workers in back wages. It was also exposed that the women working right here in the US, two hours from Santa Barbara, were making as low as $2 an hour...This is just unacceptable. I've since then decided to not participate in purchasing from Fashion Nova which for anyone who knows me, knows how hard of a decision that was and still is. I am a college student working full time who is still very much broke, so I can easily use the excuse that I work for my money and so I can spend it how I want. Come on people. At some point, we have to stick together and realize things will only change when WE, the consumers, stop purchasing from companies with such low standards of how they treat and pay their workers. This film, The True Cost, also shows the dark side of fashion and the sad reality that models get paid millions to model clothing that women are not being paid a living wage for...We can and must do better.

“The true cost” is really an amazing film which is really influential. It reflects many different perspectives from different people like workers, consumers, scientists, and so on. From all these, I as an audience can easily find out that the working condition for those workers in clothes factories is unbelievably terrible. The building can collapse and the place can even get a fire. Many workers lose their lives in all those accident just for the wage of several dollars. I think this is really unfair for them. They have to work in the danger of losing their lives in order to satisfy the request of those clothing companies to get cheep and fast productions. Just as what I said before, many people nowadays see money and interest as the most important thing in the world. They do not consider about anything else like the environment or the safety of others. This situation has to be changed as soon as possible.
       <br><br>

Informing the public us really important in sol problems like this. I think there are many way to inform the public what the truth is, and the best way to inform is to propose these information in as much different ways as possible, because we do not even know which kind of information each person prefer. For example, we can have traditional documentaries like “the true cost”, the YouTube videos like this, courses like 101, and so on. Moreover, we can also have some new forms of propaganda like tv series and comedies. Even more, we can learn from those clothing companies to use those similar techniques to produce advertisements for the public to show the truth of suffering behind those cloth.

I have to admit, I started watching this movie in agreement with some of the free trade advocates we see early in the film (despite the background music telling me I shouldn't be). I recently had a brilliant economics professor who challenged the way I look at the world. Sure, sweatshop jobs are terrible jobs by every metric, but aren't even they better than no jobs? As I learned more about economic models, I came to regard the idea of free trade highly -  specialization should be the most economically advantageous model, and for everyone, not just those at the top. I believe we're seeing the effect of that advantage with advanced medicine that can stop worldwide plagues in their tracks (not that the medical field is free from issues).

The problem with this is that it prioritizes economic progress above human lives. we can make any argument we want, but when we see a mother crying because her job is separating her from her child, and refusing to treat her with basic dignity, when we see toxic waste frothing into a river children are bathing in, it's impossible to not feel we should be fighting for something better. I read a really powerful poem recently, "Poem for the Young White Man Who Asked Me How I, an Intelligent, Well-Read Person Could Believe in the War Between Races" by Lorna Dee Cervantes. This is my favorite stanza.

"These bullets bury deeper than logic.
       <br><br>

Racism is not intellectual.
       <br><br>

I cannot reason these scars away."

       <br><br>

While Cervantes is speaking of a different experience (though racism is evident on every level of the clothing industry, and in its coverage), I believe her words apply here too. We must treat this not as an intellectual issue, but as a human issue.

You're definitely not alone in thinking that way. There are so many justifications for the current world economic model under the capitalist system, nearly all of which focus on the "benefits" that capitalism has brought and continues to bring to our lives. Whether it be advanced medicine, moderate GDP growth, increased connection and communications technology, space travel, etc, free market defenders believe that capitalism is the only way to advance as a global society. While there may be some shred of truth in these claims, they fail to consider the fundamental flaws that are written into the code of unregulated capitalism - inequality, exploitation, and unsustainable growth. 
       <br><br>


Sure, one could agree with you that working in a sweatshop is better than not having a job at all and having no income to live off of (although I'd rather not). But the problem is the fact that marginalized peoples have historically been forced into disadvantaged labor situations in which they have no other choices. When the United States and advanced Western European nations showed up in developing worlds, stole human bodies for slave labor, extracted natural resources, undermined their sovereignty, and imposed their economic and political systems upon them, they set the stage for cycles of exploitable dependent economies that feed the consumerist lifestyles of the "advanced" world. "Unfair" doesn't quite capture how wrong this model is. World Capitalism, rooted in exploitation, is inherently unjust.

I think free trade and specialization are incredibly important and also advantageous for
everyone involved. I don't think prioritizing economic progress and treating all humans
ethically are mutually exclusive goals. The conditions these workers are working in currently
are undoubtedly horrible and unsafe and those issues need to be addressed but they
need to be addressed directly, not addressed by completely throwing out the economic
model that has brought the greatest amount of prosperity and progress globally and
has lifted more people out of poverty than any other model.

Having already watched The True Cost in English 22, I watched the episode of The Patriot Act for this week’s assignment. I really did enjoy this episode, as it, as Ken mentioned, incorporated humor into the addressing of the problem and made it more accessible to the average viewer. While I agree with Ken that documentaries are an important way of spreading awareness about the climate crisis, I think that episodes of mainstream television are very powerful and underused platforms as well. These late night and reality television shows have ratings in the millions, me myself being guilty of indulging in some “trash television” every now and then, and reach a variety of audiences. While documentaries need to be made, people often opt to not watch them after a long day of work or school because they are tired and do not want to be scared or stressed, so they turn on The Bachelor instead to forget about their worries and escape reality. So, I think it’s great that Hasan Minhaj is using his platform to bring this issue to light, especially doing it with humor to keep his audience engaged and not scare them into wanting to turn off the tv or change the channel. Furthermore, knowing his audience is the typical American, I really appreciated that he ended the episode with a call for action. Often, I'm left with the feeling of “ok, but what do I do about it??” and am left feeling hopeless. Hasan offered a simple solution that is very achievable by everyone and does not require any sacrifice- just wear your clothes longer. It's a great place to start. You don't have to stop buying or make any radical changes, but if each of his viewers takes it upon themselves to make this tiny lifestyle change, it could have a significant impact.

Actually, the filmmaker states the cause of such inhumailating system clearly, it is the ideology of the US, the not-to-be-blame capitalism. In fact, to elaborate, the specific part of capitalism that people benefit mainly from economic growth and the gain in salary. The presumption is inherently flawed if these revenues generated are with the cost of much more suffering in other countries. 
       <br><br>

Now capitalism tells free trade, free is the most important issue. People here seem to be allergic to the word “government control”, regarding this word as a centralized governance by Adolf Hitler. The fear is such that even control in economics that may aim to create better goods is never favorable to voters and therefore are scarcely carried out. We can actually advise the history for how to walk out of the dilemma, since the factories in those SE Asian countries are quite similar or even worse than those 19th century British Blood Factory. In this case, as the working forces gain in social power, they can rebell themselves to fight the squeeze of the industries. However, we need to see that it is a different case, a more severe case now. As in 19th century UK, consumers and producers are in the same nation and they are fully aware of what is going on in the factories, but the great divergence and information asymmetric between workers in Vietnam and consumers in the US do create great obstacles. 
       <br><br>

Absence of adequate regulations also lead to the unlimited spread out of ads. In fact, in the video, Ken employed an example that a cosmetic corporation provides kids in their really young ages the impression of their own brands. We may feel a bit pitiful towards the young girl, but from other perspectives, we ourselves are more pitiful. As how the young girl is affected in their future is still unknown, we are at this moment led to buy more. It is not freedom at all. What is more ridiculous is that we tend to stay in the region that we think we are free and are reluctant to admit that we are not. After all, the ideology of the US, being excessively free economically, gives birth to the bloody fashion industries and keep it torturing people in third-world workers.

Having watched both Films, "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" today and "The True Cost" last year in English 22, I see myself in alignment with Thoreau on the fault lying upon the industries themselves who's most indicative goal is deeper enrich themselves at the cost of others, such as Zara's founder Amancio Ortega who I didn't even know was the fifth richest man in the world through his gains with his fast fashion industries.Anyway, my reasoning for this is through their tactics of advertisements which has more of a physiological implications than we may even perceive it. Give for instance, in the video "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion", Hasan points that these fast fashion companies like Zara and H&M claim to be "Eco-Friendly" using recyclable materials that are better for the environment, which would trick the average shopper into  believing that this true and view these companies for the better of the planet, however, this is truly wrong. "Greenwashing" is what these fast fashion companies use as they market themselves as companies for the better good of the planet, yet in reality they are not at all, but they trick people into believing that what they are buying is good for the environment through the use of impressive claims and words related to ecological goodness. In many ways, this false self entitlement of being a Green Company that is all for a better planet is honestly sinister, as in fact the fashion industry emitted more pollution and greenhouse gases than all of the international flights and maritime shipping combined. It's terrible, just terrible how these companies go out doing this with no remorse, like tossing some basil on a steak and claiming it's vegan as Hasan states it. It's even bad for the people who in the fight against Climate Change because that piece of clothing would have been made in a factory in Asia, where working conditions are poor because of the fact that these factories are pressured by big businesses to drive up production to meet there demands, exploding with pollution that effects all the lives around those factories which already drives up the Carbon Footprint with the addition of understanding that 342 million barrels of Oil are used a year just on the fashion industry. Then when you feel like you clothing has outlived it's service life or because of the fact that it's not meeting the new fad that is in, you toss it out where (to which on average a Salvation Army in NY will collect 18 tons of clothing a week) it ends up being the problem for developing nations in the Caribbean and Africa who don't have such demand for such clothing and results in 87% of the clothing exported is burned and becomes CO2 in the atmosphere, ever so adding to the problem we already face by Fossil Fuel industries. 
       <br><br>
And that is the major issue and the reason the fault lies in the hand of the Fashion Industries, as they are able to control the Western populations into believing there advertisements, showing that their new fashion products will make one feel better about themselves and keep their mental state in a buy, buy, buy mentality to ever enrich themselves. Now the reason it is so effective is because of 1. social formalities in the United States over the course of the American Dream have shifted the image of person from what they have done, via actions, into a society where people's identities are based around their material goods. 2. The problems that fast fashion evokes don't directly impact the Western Societies, but instead the developing countries in Africa and Asia, such as in the Rana Plaza incident and the River in Indonesia where children are developing liver diseases, which are out of reach from the closed minded western world who is too distracted by the growing desire of consumer goods. And 3. the illusions these companies play on us through Greenwashing, by getting us to believe in their self entitled claims of being ecologically friendly even though their own industries pollute more than airliners and maritime shipping. Thus, it all comes down to a physiological game the fashion industry plays on us and they are the puppet masters, controlling our own desires as at one point, I myself was a puppet.

I found this film very striking- I’d seen a section of it for an economics class in high school (the part with the Yale/Harvard/Stanford graduate discussing the trouble with criticizing the United States Economic System) but I hadn’t seen what context this critique was in. Among all the horrible injustices this film discussed, I think the moment that struck me the most was the segment about the garment workers protest in Cambodia. Workers and activists were peacefully protesting for an increased salary of at least $160 (it made me so mad that they had to fight for a wage that is completely unethical and not enough to support even one person, let alone a family). That is such a small wage to ask for, but the fashion industry and the government saw losing that small amount of money by paying their workers and their protests as such a risk to their financial success that they resorted to senseless violence that killed and injured many many workers and literally left the industry with blood on their hands instead of doing what’s right and paying workers a fair wage. I also thought it was really telling when Livia Firth was at the talk and asked the fashion industry representative how much they are going to pay their workers and the representative kept avoiding the question/wouldn’t say in front of the audience, as well as when the film maker reached out to major fashion corporations for their insight on this issue and they all declined to make a statement. It seems to me that the industry cares more about saving face/making it look like they care instead of actually doing what’s right just so they can keep a couple extra figures in their bank accounts and it’s really upsetting/disgusting. The overwhelming consumerism Ken discussed in this lecture now not only feels detrimental to the planet, it genuinely feels unethical now that I see how people around the world suffer just so I can get a shirt for cheap. I think taking the approach of this documentary is good because it's so raw and blatant facts, it's very sobering. I also find The Patriot Act a really good approach (I watch the show a lot) because he makes the topics he discusses, no matter how heavy or politically loaded they are, understandable to the average person and presents them in a way that makes us engaged and enjoy the experience. I think both approaches are useful and effective- I think it really just depends on who you're trying to share the information with and what manner you think they'd absorb it better in.

Producers are using tactics to convince the public that consumption is the solution to all one’s problems. The film focuses on the developing fast fashion district from the US, to Hong Kong, Milan, and India. America used to make 95% of its clothing, now it’s about 3%. 97% of clothes are outsourced by developing countries around the world. The cost of the materials has gone down, deflation, but the price of the products is the same, maybe higher. Because consumers and producers only want cheaper prices and good profit, the health of the workers has significantly gone down. A Bangladesh sweatshop had collapsed, killing some of the workers involved. Guards had seen cracks in the building and still had workers work the next day. “Low wages, unsafe conditions, and factory disasters are all excused because of the needed jobs they create”.
       <br><br>

This film relates to the class because of the amount of spending and consumption we do to the Earth. Not only does buying new clothes increase the carbon footprint, but the production hurts our environment as well. As for farming old farming habits are being outdated, and new mechanical ways are being implemented. Monsanto has become the largest seed and chemical corporation in history. Methods unhealthy for the environment are becoming more popular. Consumers are being targeted and tricked into buying somethings to “satisfy their needs”. Fast fashion, fast technology, eventually everything will become “fast”. I feel as humor isn’t the smartest way to go because people will take it even less serious than already.

Fast fashion is all about looking great with the hottest new clothing that makes you look like a celebrity but at a fraction of the price. When people go to the store, they look for the biggest bang for their buck. So if they can get something that look designer for much cheaper, they must be crazy if they don't buy it. This is what makes the knock-off brand so easy, so popular, and so accessible to the general public. Without this ease of access, fast fashion and the environmental destruction wouldn't exist on the scale that it does today. This kind of consumerism is what makes big shopping events like the holidays and especially Black Friday, so popular and seemingly irresistible. It blew my mind when he said that Americans will spent $1.1 trillion dollars during the holiday season. 

       <br><br>

It's amazing how quickly cheaper brands are able to reproduce designer clothing at a much more accessible price. It has become their main source of profits because if people see an article of clothing, they want it as soon as possible. So the brand that can give people what they want the quickest is the one that will succeed. For example, the dress worn by Kim Kardashian was ripped off by Fashion Nova within a single day. Compared to fashion in the 1950s, this reproduction speed is unimaginable. This unprecedented speed cannot come without a cost. "What we think of as the pinnacle of being glamorous involves unthinkable levels of consumption and hence causes extraordinary damage to the planet and this climate." This quote is applicable to so many aspects of our way of life, like fast food, fast fashion, and the electronics industry. The central focus of these industries is on what can appeal to consumers the most and what can produce the most profit without any regard to the consequences it can have on our species. I believe that the industries are to blame because they are the ones ingraining the idea that we aren't as valuable or desirable if we don't have their newest products. These companies play on people's insecurities and perpetuate them simply for their own personal wealth, especially when they make this kind of consumerism so normalized that the general public isn't aware of what they are doing. What we need to do is normalize awareness of this information and somehow make it desirable to boycott these company practices if we are going to make a vital impact on slowing down the effects of the climate crisis.

I was not completely clueless about the fast fashion industry prior to watching The True Cost but am so grateful for the knowledge that I learned from this film. The environmental impacts were quite clear to me before, but the elaboration on the economic standpoint behind the way that fast fashion industries are run made the picture so much clearer. These mass corporations like H&M, Gap and Levi’s do not care about not only about the environmental impacts that the production of their clothing has but also the social justice problems that arise with their production. I was horrified to see the living conditions of these people in Cambodia, Bangladesh, and other places around the world just to make a cheap t shirt. It is cruel and inhumane to force people to work for barely any money per month just because they can profit from it. The potential making of money motivates these american CEOs to do such horrible things just to be successful and live out their own consumer dreams. I was so happy to see that people are taking a step towards changing the way that clothing is produced in order to ensure that fair trade is happening between both sides. These people are not only being taken advantage of but are being treated as slaves. Hearing about the deaths of many people who literally just wanted to go to work to make a living for their kids is heartbreaking. I feel that the major corporations also attempt to hide these truths behind the process of how our clothing is made in order to keep consumers buying. This really shows how sustainable changes will do more than just help the environment but help people live true meaningful lives. Some parts of this course have made me very overwhelmed with the way that I live my life without noticing  its negative effects on myself and the environment. However, I have to look at this as an opportunity to positively change my life from this point on. I vow to thrift shop more and consume clothing much less and only when needed. I already do a mediocre job and feel that I purchase fast fashion clothing less and less as time goes on. I really do hope that others are exposed to this knowledge and have a similar reaction to mine. I know many brands like Reformation and Thred up that are working to educate as many people as possible and combat the negative environmental production of clothing. I have mentioned this many times throughout my comments but I feel that I can not stress the importance of education about these issues to the public. When watching the news I feel that many things I see are unnecessary to be reported about. I really wish that they took the time to showcase the truth behind the climate crisis in all aspects and the horrible social condition of the people who make our clothes. We are so privileged to live the way we do and not have to worry about sending our kids off to live in villages and seeing them once a year for barely any money. The sad part is that most people are unaware of this privilege at all.

I had never learned of the horrors of sweatshops in depth until watching this documentary. I felt sick watching the entire video. Hearing company owners claim that sweatshops are justified because “there are worse jobs out there” made me realize how Americans really do value their own lives above others. If the children of these company owners were put under the current conditions of those shops, they would not think twice about reforming the system. Yet, because the workers in India are not here and their problems are not our problems, it is easy for American company owners to play down the issue. 
       <br><br>
Earlier this week, I participated in a psychology experiment where my partner and I were given an issue and asked to discuss our take on the topic. We were given the issue: There was an accident at a power plant in India, where workers making $375 US dollars a year, were injured and will suffer long term lung problems. The workers were fighting to sue the company for 2 million dollars per each hurt person. If they succeed, the company would go out of business and they would have to lay off hundreds of more workers. Our job was to determine the just price that they should receive for the accident. My partner and I decided on 10k because it would be more than their wage for 20 years, and in the meantime they could try to find jobs elsewhere. After watching this video, I am not so sure I should have lowered the price, just because they live in a country with lower income. Even though these workers lived in India where income is low compared to the US, a worker with this disability could have sued for way more than 2 million in the US. I'm interested to see what other people in this class would do in this scenario, after watching this video.

I think this week's film ties into last week's film on minimalism, and exposes the extremes of consumerism us Americans join in on. Although I wrote an op-ed style comment about minimalism last week, I now see more benefits to living such a lifestyle. I buy a lot of clothes, and while some of them are from these "fast fashion" companies, most of my clothing comes from a second hand or thrift store. Still, as I was folding my laundry today and cleaning out my small dorm closet I realized I own a lot of clothing I do not wear. The clothing I have here is still not all of the clothing I own, and some still remains back at my house getting no wear or use whatsoever. I buy an article of clothing, got that shopping "high" mentioned in the beginning of this film, but never really wore it, and don't get much enjoyment out of it. I completely see that sometimes, we can mistakenly try to fill a void with material items and soon return back to the same emptiness, despite still owning that original item. What sucks even more is that getting rid of our unused clothing creates a massive amount of waste, so I feel like I'm just kinda stuck hanging onto it. I genuinely feel bad about the amount of clothing I have bought in the past, and I think it is due to this comic's relatability and humor. His approach to relaying such shocking and depressing information was ingenious, as I felt engaged and excited to hear what joke or hyperbole would come out of his mouth next. His "H-M" idea he used to expose the waste and lies behind real H&M clothing to real people shows just how few of us really know the truth. I knew fast fashion implemented the use of underpaid, overworked employees and probably weren't doing anything positive for the environment, but I had no idea how many lies there were that I believed for so long.

"The Ugly Cost of Fast Fashion" was a really cool take on getting people to listen to environmental problems. The host kept the crowd entertained but still shoved in facts about the horrible realities of fast fashion. I think some people can't sit through long documentaries about things they have never heard of, and wouldn't even click on such films or videos in the first place. It is relatable and helps people watching understand what is going on without a bias.
       <br><br>
Overall I still find the whole thing quite shocking. After watching "The True Cost" last quarter, I reevaluated all of my clothing choices and made sure to not support any fast fashion. Seeing the people who suffer and have to go through sweatshops to make the best living situation for their families that they can is heartbreaking. We should not be supporting the torture of people in developing countries just because it is there. There do not need to be 52 seasons of clothing and we shouldn't be buying clothes to throw away a week later, it is selfish and destroying our earth at a fast pace. The woman who interviewed people saying how much water goes into producing clothes is really helping shoppers like the man who said he had no idea how many pounds of water go into making clothes(which the one shirt she pointed out equaled 24 years of drinking water for one person I believe). Fast fashion is indeed happening too fast and people need to know what is going into the production and where they go when "donated"; aka to countries in Africa as waste and they then burn. The companies that try to come off as green and help the planet but are in reality lying make me sick and they shouldn't be allowed to falsely advertise as such. IT is creating such a huge problem it will be hard to come down from the waste. It's so easy to not support fast fashion, don't buy unnecessary clothes or go thrift, it's that easy and just as cheap. 
       <br><br>
To answer Ken's question, I think both parties are at fault. The creator of Zara did also create the layout for fast fashion but there is still the high consumer demand for cheap clothing. People need to know where their clothes come from and better alternatives that don't harm innocent people and the planet.

The True Cost had the same effect on me: it moved me to reconsider my clothing choices and want to commit to forsaking fast fashion. It really opened my eyes to how American consumerism supports brands that disregard people in third world countries who are just doing the best they can to support their families. The film really did impact me deeply. I broke down in tears when it got to the labor riots in Cambodia. Completely heart wrenching. I’ve known for a while now that shopping at stores like H&M and Forever 21 is the opposite of sustainable. I’ve probably bought less than 10 new items of clothing in the past 12 months, which I take pride in. I’ve done this by accepting clothes handed down, and I also find it really rewarding to shop at local thrift stores. It’s way more environmentally friendly, and I do love a good bargain—yes, even better than the prices at mall stores. Guess what? If you’re getting your clothes from the thrift store, most of them have lasted long enough to get there because of the good quality! You can’t say the same for cheap mall clothes. It’s not like this is new to me, however, since I grew up poor and my mom basically raised me in thrifted clothes (which I got compliments on through elementary school (even though I used to feel like I had to lie about where I got them)). The woman in the film said, in tears, that she did not want people buying clothes made from blood, because it only maintains the system that people like her are suffering through. Everyone should definitely make a complete switch from “fast fashion” to “sustainable shopping.”

I enjoyed watching “The Ugly Cost of Fast Fashion” because Hasan Minhaj used a lot of sarcasm and black humor. The comedy way of discussing a huge topic like climate change is intriguing. At the moment when people were laughing at his jokes, they are building a consensus that the fashion industry is bad for the environment. In the film, he never directly complained about how nasty the situation is. But every audience got to know about the truth. 
<br><br>

However, I think using comedy to approach issues on climate change only works on the people with introductory-level knowledge about the issue. The idea you can stuff into a joke or a skit is limited and superficial. People might laugh for 30 seconds then forget what he was talking about. All I could remember from that film is that you need tons of water to make a jacket. I believe a good speech consists of both humor and seriousness. Most "good politicians” (good in speech) set their tone using a few jokes then become very touching and sympathetic in the next ten or fifteen minutes. It's like an online date: you need a funny starter then talk as if you actually have a heart.

I found your comment hilarious! and I completely agree. you need to get the tone at first, then become serious, just like politicians, to win over people. I am surprised that Ken chose this video to show to us because as you said, it is supposed to be more of funny entertainment then actually knowledgeable, even though there is a lot of knowledge in this episode, all his episodes contain a lot of factual knowledge. I find it funny the poll he did in class the other day; a fifth of the whole class had bought something DURING the class!!! unbelievable. how much stuff do you actually need?! i hate the Amazon culture these days. Support Local! use your clothes and stuff until they are unusable, then fix them instead of getting new ones! I know that there are so many people that are into fast fashion and even after watching these videos and taking this class, will continue to buy all sorts of stuff all the time, that they don't need.

People seat in front of fashion shows and enjoy elegant models with fancy clothes passing by. We cannot see the ugly truth behind it or we do not want to talk about the ugly truth. When demand for fashion increases, capitalists start to find cheap labor in Asian countries which have a great deal of population. They open a lot of clothes assembly factories in China, Vietnam and Bangladesh etc. Cheap labor means labors receive lowest minimum wage in the world. To make more profit, companies make workers' work environment become worse. I am truly shocked by what happened in Dhaka before. This was really a tragedy for Bangladesh people, and it also shows that chemicals in clothes factories harm workers a lot. When I was 8 years old, I found a big change happening in my country: more and more factories were built in the city. They made clothes for companies like Nike, Adidas and many other brands. When people in the world wear fancy clothes Made In China, they ignore what happened in some Chinese cities: many rivers were polluted by chemicals from factories including Yangtze River. We were silent for years because we thought we also benefited from these trades, but we saw more serious problems like water crisis later. The government spent a lot of money in controlling water pollution. Cheap labor does not mean to squeeze local workers hard. First, companies like H&M should obey local environment laws. Second, they should increase minimum wage and change work conditions for labors. " The True Cost" of a pretty dress should not be the cost of workers' health.

<p>
After watching the film. “The True Cost” I am truly disgusted. I can’t believe this happening. I hope we realize that we are being purely selfish, evil people. We are only aware of what we 
<br><br>
purchase/buy but not the process. I actually just learned about this in my global studies class, it is so sad because companies are abusing their power knowing that third world countries want jobs. They look for countries who are in an economic crisis by having the product manufactured in that country, the economy will eventually increase. Yes, this does increase jobs for people in India however they are being overworked, work conditions are awful, wages are very low, and it is basically slave labor. India is not the only place that this is occurring in, in Latin American countries along with other third world countries are also experiencing this. I know if the roles were reversed and we were a third world country that had sweatshops we would definitely be upset, mad, and angry and be asking for help. It is unfair and It is dehumanizing to people to be overworking them. So, the next time you decide to purchase something from H&M, Zara, Nike, or Adidas rethink it and ask yourself if it is really worth it. The only reason that these third world countries have to undergo these conditions is due to the demand; instead of 4 major seasons of clothing, there is now 52 seasons which means that there are new clothing pieces almost each week! These stores are putting out new articles of clothing into the market for sale that is hindering economic growth in third world countries and contributing to environmental deficiencies in society.

I wouldn't go as far as calling anyone that gives into the fast fashion industry evil. Ignorance is not the same as evil. Even some of the people who outsource the jobs to third world countries seem to have convinced themselves that it is for the best of that country. What shocks me the most is that after the Rana Plaza disaster, and similar incidents, there was no change to the status quo. You mentioned role reversal. Hypothetically, if something like that was to happen here to U.S citizens, it would be unlikely to ever happen again. Take 9/11 as an extreme example. 9/11 led to an entire upheaval of how America views travel and changed our relations with the Middle East forever. Coming off of that, it would be sane to think, "OK. The U.S is not the type to let disaster go unchecked. The U.S makes a change when tragedy strikes". However, because this disaster didn't happen to U.S citizens and the conditions these workers suffer benefit our economy, we don't care. We let companies continue business as usual despite partial responsibility for the deaths of hundreds. I'm completely ignorant about how the law works when it comes to company relations with foreign countries. However, I'm upset that there doesn't seem to be some prosecution of those in the U.S who continue to allow the endangerment of the people who allow the company to run smoothly. The government is also responsible. These companies are massive. They can afford to at least make sure foreign workers are treated humanely, if not well. Regulation is necessary regardless of how it impacts future campaign contributions.

The True Cost was truly heartbreaking to watch. The fact that our culture has caused these men, women, and children in developing countries to suffer in such terrible conditions is extremely upsetting. When the film referenced costs of t-shirt beings driven down to around $3 and then to find out that these workers are only being paid around $2 a month literally blows my mind. Our culture is essentially saying that this cheap piece of clothing that we will surely throw away or not use within a year is worth more than an actual human life. This fact is proven with the disaster at Rana Plaza. To think that someone suffered their whole life working in that terrible sweatshop to produce our clothing and then for them to probably have a life earnings worth less than a coat we could get at H&M is crazy. How can we as Americans who preach freedom and human rights support such an act. We must stop our ways in the fashion industry as what's happening here is not only a climate issue, but a humanities issue. The video referenced it to modern day slavery which I feel is not a far off comparison. We are truly paying these people absolutely nothing, do not care for their safety, and work them to death. The video just invoked much anger in me but I am curious in knowing what fashion brands do not support this way of sweatshops and actually provide their workers with good working conditions? I would definitely like can answer to this as I would love to give my money to them over these other brands that have no care for basic human rights.

"The True Cost" was so eye opening to me, with how it showed fast fashion is affecting the environment and the people of areas where they produce many of the world's clothes. Fast fashion keeps costs so low, with many turning a blind eye of how they have gotten that cost. The film did not even get the effects of outsourcing on American workers and quality of clothes, which could possibly be another video entirely. But I think once people know how much the fast fashion industry damages the planet , such as the runoff from chemicals treating leather going into the water supply and large amounts of pollution from factories. These conditions have made the people that live in these areas develop poor health, such as Jaundice. There is no telling the long term damage these people will have to face with their bodies, such as growth of organs and the body itself with youth. The workers themselves are also so at risk and mistreated. One incident in the video, a fast fashion factory collapsed, leaving 100 young girls dead. But almost no one around the world batted an eye a week after it occurred. These poor working conditions persist for these people, and tragedies like these are only bound to happen again. In addition, these workers are paid so low and forced to work long hours so fast fashion companies can reach price and quantity quotas. No life is worth somone's sweater. The sad reality is that the $10 sweater bought at H&M will likely only be worn a few times and then thrown out to be recycled or in a dump. So all that hard work and human and nature cost, just for a few wears in clothing.
<br><br>
The video also addressed the dangers of the GMO, specifically in cotton for clothing in America and abroad. With global demand only continuing the increase with clothing (more people on the world/fast fashion influence), cotton had to be industrialized to make quota. These cotton crops are engineered as well as sprayed with anti-weed and bug spray to protect them. But, this can only come at a cost. The long term effects on the soil is yet to be seen, nor the effect on human skin when we wear cotton that is genetically modified. Monsato says all of this is safe, but it would be hard to tell that to many of the farmers who have developed cancers while working with crops that are geneticially modified. This phenomena did not happen as much as before, but cancer rates boomed with GMO's. These effects cannot be ignored and must continue to be scrutinized. For ourselves, as the film said, we can look inward and change our own habits with fashion, so that demand can be lower and things can begin changing in the fashion industry.

The film “the true cost really made me mad with just the simple snippet of the lady describing “Fast Fashion” and the concept of 52 seasons. I don't know how so many people can have so many clothes and simply stop wearing certain articles of clothing because they are “out of style”. That being said, I realize I'm part of the problem.  
<br><br>
I brought only some of my clothes from home to UCSB and still have a full closet and wardrobe at home. When I go back I will donate my extra garments to an organization that will distribute them to people who are in need.

The True Cost was difficult to watch. It is hard to imagine just how many people are going through those working conditions everyday, just so Old Navy can sell a $10 t-shirt. I’m not sure how I feel about the idea of sweatshops. Ideally, they provide more jobs to communities that need them, they are safer than many other jobs, and it helps the country’s economy. However, it is not like that most of the time. Sweatshops are full of intensive labor, harsh working conditions, and inadequate pay. If the environment and plan behind sweatshops were more fairly executed, I would feel better about sweatshops, but seeing the way those workers live makes me sick.
<br><br>

This insane consumerism culture and the rate that fast fashion is increasing gives me very little hope for the future. I feel like every documentary I watch and every reading I do gives me less and less hope for the future. Our habits aren’t going to stop. Humans are comfortable in their ways, and there aren’t enough willing to change. It would be one thing if the damage we are doing to the planet was plateauing. Then we could start chipping away at the damage being done. But we are actually increasing the amount of damage we are doing to the earth, with no sign of slowing down. We can’t even continue to damage the planet at the same rate! We continue to one-up ourselves decade after decade, year after year. Fashion is just one example of this. We are buying more and more clothes every year, without worrying about the repercussions. This documentary especially made me feel like we are too far gone, and there is no way to stop or change the trajectory we are on.

I liked watching The True Cost. I felt that they were able to educate people on the issue while also giving solutions to solve the issues. This film was able to really highlight the dangers of fast fashion. From it harming our health, environment, and even the economy. I was pretty surprised to learn that Americans spent about $1.1 trillion on just Black Friday. I did not know Americans had that much money to spend on materialistic things, but it just does not but demonstrate how materialistic we Americans are.
<br><br>

I learned a bit about this topic when I took AP environment science when I was in high school, but still found myself feeling shocked from all the statistics that they gave. I was surprised that fashion is the most labor dependent industry in the world and is the second most harmful industry for the environment. After watching this film, I do not intend on shopping at fast-fashion shops in the future and want to only purchase clothes that is not as harmful. 
<br><br>

I would say most people generally know that living a consumerist lifestyle is not environmentally friendly. However, I think this film will give any viewer a harsh wake up call that they must do something about how they approach buying clothes. That there are real people suffering in sweat shops for the sake of us getting a “good deal” for a shirt. Even the beginning of the film, with showing people losing their lives from a factory disaster immediately shows just how dark the fast fashion industry is. It infuriates me how the clothing company owners are the ones who gain the most from people's sufferings. I hope that they soon make an actual change because this damage is not worth the economic gain.
<br><br>

By showing the workers conditions, children dying , and the people in Bangladesh being exploited, I feel pessimistic on how we live in the United States. I wish that I could do more to really help the people there, but things will not change until more of the public are aware of just how important this issue is. For now, I will just shop at thrift stores rather than go to the mall for my clothes.

It is truly depressing, how people’s lives are in those countries. As I watched True Cost, I couldn’t believe my eyes. How could employers exploit workers to that extent? Why aren’t there any regulatory authorities stopping this before it is too late and rubble falls on hundreds? I thought moving here to America and put up with the less appealing food was enough for me, but people in India, Cambodia, and Vietnam are still working for their survival. My country used to have the cheapest human labor, now things have changed and this “responsibility” of manufacturing has fallen onto neighboring countries. Yet I am not happy at all. I hope we could do something for them. I guess the best way to help is to live a minimalistic lifestyle. We don’t need that many clothes, we just have to have a few pieces of clothes we love a lot.

When I watched the State of the Union address last night, many of the points in The True Cost became surprisingly relevant. The first part of Trump's speech was essentially stating statistics about the nation, ones that are supposed to be indicators of our progress. Many of them, I found, had questionable connotations. There was a theme of progress in terms of maximizing employment and economic growth, especially in terms of the stock market and GDP. However, as The True Cost notes, GDP is merely a measure of goods traded. It fails to capture the underlying environmental and possibly humanitarian costs of these goods being traded (the Bangladeshi garment workers are a particularly pertinent example where high production is a severe detriment). In addition, the stock market can reflect consumer confidence, but the flipside of this is the continuing plague of consumerism as we fill our homes with more products (especially clothing) that we have been conditioned to want thanks to advertising. Employment is up, but do these jobs provide living wages, fair healthcare benefits, ample maternity/paternity leave, etc? How many are working multiple low wage jobs to get by? Certainly there are big upsides to each of these measures of growth, but unprecedented growth is simply unsustainable. I don't ask for people to not want low unemployment or a strong stock market, but to instead look deeper at these statistics and think of what they actually mean, not extrapolating "growth" to "progress" for the nation in all cases, unquestionably. 

<br><br>

On another note, I was surprised by the immediate effects that the chemicals involved in production can have on surrounding communities. First was the effects of cotton pesticides on the villages in Punjab, India. The mental and physical conditions that struck them at such high rates were truly shocking, but the part that I couldn't believe were the suicides of the farmers. 250k suicides among farmers in 16 years is an unfathomable amount, "the largest recorded wave of suicides in history". The fact that Monsanto is willing to run a business that drives so many to suicide is telling of the nature of unadulterated capitalism. Second was the incidence of brain cancer in Lubbock, Texas. This case, I feel, may hit closer to home literally and figuratively for many Americans. Greater risk of brain cancer due to use of pesticides in our own country may seem far more alarming than similar conditions halfway across the world, sad as that case may be. Legislation in that region might be easier to produce and enforce as well, since the efforts of Congress to draft any kind of fair global trade bill has immediately been thwarted by any and all fast fashion companies. Rural Texans could plainly see the way pesticides have affected their community. This touches on the broader point I want to make: stopping environmental injustice has to start on the individual/activist and the local levels. Once this sort of support has grown, a greater consciousness of these issues among Americans will cause a bigger push on Congress to enforce fair trade on companies acting globally.

The film “The True Cost” was extremely eye opening for me. I had no idea about many of the social issues in these countries. It made me realize what a bubble I am in living in the US. I cannot believe the story about the collapsed building in Bangladesh that killed so many people. The state of workshops/sweatshops is despicable. The way the fashion industry takes advantage of these people is terrible as well. The farmers of India who get swindled into taking on debt then having their farm taken off them is horrible. I could not believe that statistic about the suicide rate of Indian farmers being every 1 suicide every 30 minutes accross 16 years. The fact people are treated this way and taken advantage of to fulfill our greed for consumerism is disheartening. Seeing the interviews of the Americans who brushed it off with flimsy excuses or explanations was frustrating as well. The worst part is I don’t see a way how any of this can be reversed. It is so ingrained and normalized in our society. Most people don’t think twice about the things they are consuming or how it was made.

I totally agree! This was also very eye opening for me as well. After watching the suffering of the people create our clothes, grow our crops and work to make everything we consume today, I became nauseous towards all the clothing I have bought for 25-20 dollars. These poor workers from factories in Bangladesh and Cambodia only earned 3 dollars a day and received beatings from their bosses to produce a cheap piece of cloth. Those 3 dollars a day were not enough for workers to live a good life and feed their children. The film then comes to explore the cotton production in India. This demonstration further saddened me and made me hate the idea of consumptions even more. Farmer suicides every 30 minutes and the contamination of pesticides causing cancer and other sorts of fatal disease in children. It’s unbelievable that yet, owners of factories and every single person who is to blame for this including us consumers, continue do what we do. It’s even affecting our mental health. The more we have, the less happy we become so why have it all. I can just finish with saying that this is terrible and we have to work to end it somehow. We can’t continue such an unfair, sad, and dangerous life.

Growing up we are taught that more is better, so by today's standards buying over 68 items of clothing per year is normalized. But when compared to the 1980s when it was only around 12 items, it becomes clear that there is a problem here. This issue lies in the fact that we are constantly sold on this idea that we need something new every single time we receive an ad. It's sad that we have become so brainwashed as to believe that only through having an absurd amount of stuff will we be happy. One shocking fact that Minhaj brings attention to is that the average American throws away 80 pounds of clothes a year. Why are we buying so much when ultimately we're just going to throw it away in a few weeks? It's even worse when you realize that donating won't solve the problem because most of it still ends up thrown away. These clothes are then either incinerated or sent to developing countries. Fast Fashion is so successful because they are able to manipulate people into believing that they need 20 or more shirts. We the consumers are constantly trying to catch up with all the 52 seasons, that we don't stop to realize just how ridiculous this all is. 
<br><br>
I think what really hits home is just how destructive the Fashion Industry truly is. In 2015 Textile production released more greenhouse gases than international flights and maritime shipping combined. Flying is the absolute worst thing you can do environmentally, and yet the Fashion Industry is producing more CO2 emissions. What is also astonishing is the sheer amount of oil used to make clothes....approximately 342 million barrels of oil per year! Who wants plastic and oil in their clothes? The clothing process relies so much on chemicals that villages with factories because sick. Entire rivers are polluted and children are killed by the disease. Even the actual factory conditions are horrible as we have seen in the True Cost. There's just so much wrong with the Fashion Industry and its honestly so disturbing that there is nothing being done about it.

After watching The True Cost, I was so shocked by the accidents in clothes factories. In many poor areas, such as Bangladesh and Vatican, people work in garment factories for living. However, their salary is too low to support their lives. Because of the development of fast fashion, workers are squeezed by the garment companies. In order to produce clothes in a low cost, workers’ salary must be really low and their working situation is poor. They actually worked in dangerous buildings even though they discovered the building will collapse in some days. The building collapse of Rana Plaza caused thousands of people’s death and many wounded. However, there are still some people did not think they should take responsibilities on this bad event. If the top leading clothes companies did not focus too much on their profits, the tragedy might not happen. Besides, it is essential to grow cotton if people want clothes. To increase the production of cotton, many farmers use chemical fertilizers to kill the pests. However, soil and environment is badly affected by chemical spray. Farmers who grow cotton under chemical condition are more likely to get a cancer and die young.
<br><br>
Garment companies only pay attention to those direct cost, money they need to pay for producing clothes. But indirect cost is also important. For example, sewage discharged when producing clothes pollute rivers and lakes. People living in the village rely on these source of water. People there get skin disease, amentia, and cancer and wait for death due to a lack of clean water and poverty. Also, chemical fertilizers sprayed into air impact the environment badly.
<br><br>
These phenomena must be adjusted either by increasing minimum wage or by decreasing production of goods.

While watching The True Cost, multiple times I found myself trying not to cry. I felt shameful while watching this documentary. While I knew that most of our clothes were made across the world in countries like China, I had no idea what the working conditions were. I knew that the conditions were bad, but I never took interest in finding out how truly bad they were, probably so that I wouldn’t have to face the truth and could still mindlessly buy my $10 T-shirts. After watching this documentary and seeing the horrific things that the factory workers have to go through, I am very shameful of my past purchases. Seeing that 1,000 people were killed when a building literally collapsed on them while they were working was horrifying. Seeing the riots in Cambodia where 5 people were killed in the streets over wanting a $160 monthly wage was terrifying. Seeing the children who were born with defects and children that have to go to school far away from their parents so that they can safely get an education was heartbreaking. It truly impacted me when one woman said, “I don’t want anyone wearing anything which is produced by our blood.” These were the scenes that made me feel guilty as a consumer and convinced me to change my ways. Clothing is something that everyone owns, and we have a choice of where we get it! We make a choice of who we are supporting and demanding goods from each time we make a purchase. 

<br><br>

As the film went on, I felt that, while it is still VERY important that consumers like me change our ways (as supply and demand is what drives production), it is more important that companies change their ways, and I am unsure of how this will happen. I was furious to learn that the fashion industry is a 3 trillion dollar a year industry right after learning that the workers in Bangladesh were working for a minimum wage of $3 a day. That is unacceptable! The industry has plenty of money to pay their workers correctly and businesses like People Tree prove it! Seeing that companies would only comply to their own code of conduct and refuse to join an open code angered me further. Without laws that FORCE these companies to change, they won’t. 

<br><br>

Honestly, I have no idea how to answer Ken’s question this week. People who know of these problems and WANT to learn more will, but people like me who wanted to hide from the truth won’t do it on their own, and the companies making the clothing definitely won't help them because it is not of their interest. Take a grocery store which sells both conventional and organic produce for example. They can try to market you to buy the organic produce because, no matter which you buy, they are still going to make a profit. But in the case of a clothing store, if they tell you that half of their clothes are ethically made and the other half are not, the consumer is probably going to question the store and leave. Because of this, the company is never going to advertise these things. So, who does advertise the effects of this then? How do we get the public to be aware of these problems when they are making purchases? I don’t know. I hope that Ken poses some ideas during class.

Hasan Minhaj’s “The Ugly Truth Of Fast Fashion” reminded me, again, of how I really need to do more research on the clothes I’m buying. I always knew that brands such as Zara or H&M were very detrimental to the environment being that they were cheaply made and made under whichever circumstance. However, I always assumed that the more expensive the brand, the more likely it is sustainable or ethically made, so, the LuluLemon thing kind of surprised me. I honestly shouldn’t be surprised since they are aggressively overpriced anyway but I didn’t really connect the dots on the material it was being made with like polyester, nylon and spandex were made with oil. Like, it just doesn’t seem like that would have anything to do with making cloth. 
 <br><br>
Though that made me sad because I am a white girl who likes Lulu, I am really glad that there are sustainable brands that are newly hitting the market, or at least ones that are truly trying. I love how he pointed out that “‘sustainable’ has no legal definition,” because honestly, that is so blatantly obvious but something I never really took to think about. I remember in ES3 we went over the concept of greenwashing, the idea that brands will promote one aspect of their product that is eco-friendly, for example O.B. tampons claim to save 1 pound of waste per women due to getting rid of applicators but “forgets” to mention herbicides, insecticides, fertilizers, fungicides, and other chemicals used to produce cotton crops in the United States (please buy organic tampons im begging you). But, in regards to clothing and people who like Lululemon but now don’t want to buy it because of the oil statistic (and price), I know this one girl I’ve been following on instagram that created a athletic wear brand for women that is attempting to be completely vegan and eco-friendly (besides shipping, we can’t really help that until there are ways to distribute things with a lessened carbon-footprint) called Tala. I haven’t bought them yet but I’ve heard great reviews. Regardless, I feel as if it is a great direction for influencers to use their platforms for if they are making merchandise or starting clothing brands as they hold a lot of influence over what people choose to buy or think is cool. 
<br><br>
 Along with this, the statistic that the average woman buys 64 clothing items a year is kind of insane, and then when thinking of myself, I realized I am probably one of those people (or close to) which honestly makes me so mad at myself because I don't think I buy that many clothes. However, I totally do, something to work on for sure. Like yes, I thrift things, but to tie it back to the idea of minimalism from the film from this week, I still don't need it. Thing is, I really don't. It's not worth hurting the Earth anyway.

I also chose to watch Hasan Minhaj’s “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” since I had seen “The True Cost” while enrolled in English 22. I totally agree with the points you have made in this comment regarding the video. I was also surprised at the harm that Lululemon is causing to the environment. In Ken’s video on the respective films, he discusses the role that advertising plays in consumer experience and the desire for consumers to purchase goods. I completely agree and feel like marketing/advertising and even “in-store” experience plays such a large role in these kinds of brand’s success. In my eyes, Lululemon is a much higher quality brand than Zara or H&M. I have had some Lululemon products last for years (with the occasional lemon here and there) whereas something from Zara or H&M would be worn out by the end of the season. The experience one is given when entering a Lululemon store is very different than H&M or Zara as well. I find when visiting Lululemon that the store is laid out in a very organized and intentional manor—playing up the luxury “athleisure” aesthetic. I don’t regularly shop at Zara but the few times I have been in the stores it feels like complete chaos—clothes thrown everywhere and people madly running around the store, sorting through piles of clothing. I bring up these points because I find it interesting how experience and advertising can sway certain shoppers so easily. 
<br><br>


After watching “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” I did some research into one of my favorite brands, Reformation (aka Ref), (https://www.thereformation.com/) that currently claims to have some of the most stainable and ethical practices. While looking through the a section of their website regarding the fabric they source for their pieces, I found out that they use TENCEL™ Lyocell. Tencel is a part of the Rayon family which in Hasan’s video is demonized for it’s wasteful uses—30% is used in garments and a whopping 70% is disposed. Ref claims that their Tencel is made from Eucalyptus trees which grow quickly and require little water. The part I found most interesting is that they claim that the creation of Tencel is “a closed loop production process” and that all of the remaining solvent is recycled. The Tencel is not produced by Ref, but, but instead is processed in Austria by a company called Lenzing. Ref also uses viscose in their clothing, and in this same section they have included that they are working with a non-profit on forest conservation, restoration, and protection. I found all of this information so interesting since I have been a fan of Ref’s clothing items for a few years and was initially drawn to the brand due to all the praise it was receiving for being “eco-friendly”!

After watching the documentary film, “The True Cost,” I truly was at a loss for words.  I never realized what goes on behind what the average consumer sees in the fashion industry.  When thinking about the climate crisis and the negative impacts occurring on our planet, I never considered the beef or fashion industry to take part in the making of these impacts.  It was very sad to see what poorer countries have to go through to try to maintain a job in order to have a decent living.  The sad reality is that the fast fashion industry has no consideration for what multiple people (mostly women) deal with through the working conditions they are supplied with.  Watching the film, I did not expect to see people lose their lives over the fashion industry.  It was quite heartbreaking to see that people who only wanted to make a decent living and fight for better wages were punished for their bravery.  This film was very eye-opening to me because as a young woman myself in a society that looks up to these large industries, I now view them as shameful for not fighting for the rights and decent living of all people.  For these major corporations to be able to operate in a system where they can pay a group of people very low wages ($3 a day I believe in Bangladesh) and not be held accountable when they are mistreated is unfair and needs to change.  The entire system of how we as consumers purchase our products must be analyzed and made to be more efficient in order to help solve the climate crisis.

I completely agree, after watching “The True Cost” I was heartbroken. I had absolutely no idea what a detrimental effect the fashion industry has on the planet. After watching this movie I realized that it’s not just an environmental concern, but a human rights issue too. America outsources 97% of all our fashion, using cheap labor for fast results. People in underdeveloped countries are exposed to chemicals, get paid a small amount, and work in buildings that are prone to collapsing or lighting on fire. The abuses don’t just stop there, the farming and cotton industry has been destroyed as well. With the heavy use of pesticides and GMO chemicals, farmers are falling into debt and not seeing the results they need. Chemicals are having an effect on the soil and the community, ruining lives. I was horrified to see how widespread the horrors of the fashion industry are, effecting those in the fields to those in the sweatshops. 
 <br><br>

As a female, I was saddened to hear how the majority of workers in sweatshops are women. They can’t even protect themselves, as unions are limited and ignored. This massive problem seemingly falls on corporations but when I looked deeper at the problem, we each play a part. I often buy my clothing without looking at where it was made or comes from. I don’t consider if it is from a company that does fair trade. After watching this movie I am committed to making a change and telling my family to do the same. I am appalled, embarrassed, and disgusted that we are all enabling these human rights abuses. People are dying, chemicals are ruining the environment, and our carbon footprint is continuing to grow. Our consumer culture has to change.


<br><hr>

Before watching this film, I was expecting to learn only about the environmental impacts of the fashion industry, such as emissions produced from factories or how much material ends up in landfills. I did not expect to be so heartbroken by the humanitarian problems of this industry. I liked your point about being a young woman and looking up to these companies. We are primed from a young age to strive to be like the girls we see in fashion shows and commercials. But the sad reality is that these companies do not care about the wellbeing of their employees, especially the ones overseas who are exploited for cheap labor. Educating people on the true costs of fast fashion is so important if  we want to end our society’s dependence on this industry. Just talking to friends about the humanitarian and environmental benefits of buying clothing second hand can be helpful. This is just another harrowing example of how our society’s obsession of stuff is not only ruining the planet, but ruining lives.


<br><hr>
I would like to add that this can be lessened or even stopped by a minimalist or partially minimalist life style. Valuing our clothes instead of wearing them for a week then buying new ones could put a large financial strain on these companies.  The workers across the world can try to fight for larger wages and better conditions, but they would not be listened to. It is up to us, the ones causing the problem to fix it. Also, by fixing this we not only save countless lives across the world, but we save our world. I was shocked to read that the fashion industry is the second largest emitter of pollution behind the oil industry. Laws that were made in the US to protect us, like clean air and water acts, pollution laws and the sort can be blatantly  ignored in other countries, and actually protected by governments yearning for a stop in the developed world. 

 <br><br>

I was also appalled by the behavior of some of the people at the beginning of the film who said this is the best option for these workers. Yes it may be the best option, but it is still atrocious. Just because these people live in a different place than we do, it can be justified that they can legally suffer through things that would be illegal to do to Americans. This logic makes no sense to me, the old mantra says treat others the way you want to be treated, seems fitting here.

I was amazed after watching "The True Cost" of how manufactures cut corners in order to make just a little more profit. The amount that  workers in these poor countries are exploited is amazing for how much these companies make, you think some money would be put back towards the workers. Not only the bad working conditions, but also the harm to the environment is ridiculous as toxins are pumped out into rivers that only lead to polluting more and more areas. Personally, i really enjoy when companies are transparent about their practices and strive to be more cleaner with production.

Companies will do everything they can to make more and more money. They claim they are the good guys because they are creating jobs, but the jobs they are creating are in unethical conditions or have less than optimal pay. However, I find it hard to blame them for taking advantage of these places and people because us, the consumers, continue buying their product. I agree with you in your sentiment of appreciating companies being transparent, but they have no incentive to be so. Countries could start passing laws requiring companies to put a label on their products saying "ATTENTION: This product is made in (insert country here) in terrible conditions". As consumers, we need to be more responsible and do our research if we really care about this issue. We need to stop buying products until their producers have working conditions that they deserve.

My general reaction to the film was anger because the moment I saw how the workers were being treated, I wanted to find a way to help immediately. Then I realized I was contributing to the problem because of my recent materialistic purchases of clothing and I felt extremely regretful. This film made me ponder on how I could make a difference, and once I find an efficient solution, I will put it in use.  From my observation of the film, effective communication was accomplished by the filmmakers by showing the consequences of the materialistic and capitalistic culture of first-world countries on third-world countries. Because of this “fast fashion” phenomenon, companies need to keep up with the demand and make a profit, so they exploit people who live in countries like China and Bangladesh by paying them low wages and providing poor working environments.
  <br><br>
When people shop for clothing, they aren’t concerned about who manufactured it or how it was done. Instead, consumers are concerned with how it looks when tried on or what sizes are available. Hopefully more people become concerned with the practices of these clothing companies and become aware of how damaging materialism is on the environment. After watching the film, I learned a lot about the many negative effects on the environment caused by materialism and the practices of the clothing industry. I have heard of popular companies such as Nike and Adidas exploiting foreign workers in third-world countries, but I did not know how horrible these work environments truly were. Now that I am informed, before any purchase of clothing, I will do my research on the company and determine whether or not their practices are morally right. If their way of producing clothing does not align with my morals, I will not purchase any products from their establishment. I am optimistic about the future because people are becoming more aware about the harsh conditions of clothing workshops and how these products are produced, and as a result, things can change.

"The True Cost" is a very important film, and it's one that I think would benefit my generation if everyone was required to watch it somehow. As a young adult, especially at UCSB, I see plenty of students around me who dress nice every day, and always seem to have some kind of cute look going on. Even in my discussions with my friends, we often talk about how we wish we had more money so we could buy new clothes that are in season. Sentiments like these stem from our capitalistic culture that we were raised in; the more we work, the more we can buy things that make our lives better (in this case, clothes). Last year, I spent so much money at Urban Outfitters that I became a Rewards member and qualified for free shipping (leading to me spending more). It was a lot of unnecessary money on clothes, with a lot of them going unworn most of the time because I realized they were not really my style.
  <br><br>


Watching this film really puts it into perspective how dangerous this mindset is; the more we reward these fast fashion companies with our money and desperation to buy clothes that are "in season," the worse things get for the third-world countries that produce these clothes, such as what happened in the Rana Plaza Disaster. The scary part about this is we are all mostly aware of how we are addicted to a life of material. But we just laugh it off because we don't see anything wrong with it. If everyone was required to watch this film, maybe my generation would realize that rewarding people for constantly buying new clothes is bad. Luckily, thrifting is something that is looked at highly in society, and it seems that it is only getting more popular. But we have already made such a negative impact already with our addiction to fashion that the world has already seen destructive consequences.

In regards to your comment, I agree that the change must start at the consumer level. In my opinion, the large fashion companies that we see today in society are never stop producing new clothes in such small amounts of time simply because of the economic benefit this system provides. Although consumers are not technically responsible for creating this flawed system, in fact we are in a way coerced into contributing to it, it is ultimately up to us to force a change in the industry. It is not until that companies are publicly criticized and profits reduced that they will consider making changes. For instance, this film was produced in 2015 and since then, companies such as H&M and Zara have started working towards more green initiatives, although still not as rigorously as our planet probably needs. It is especially true as college students that we tend to value our appearances and even enjoy shopping for new clothes; I too, enjoy these things. However, I think it is critical of us to shop and dress with an environmental and ethical conscience. I definitely agree that the act of thrift shopping is becoming an integral part of a new wave of environmentally sound fashion for our generation, which I think is a great thing. Although I wish that everyone could simply watch this film and instantly gain a fashion conscience, it's just not realistic. Unfortunately, I don't really see our fast fashion culture going anywhere just yet. I just hope that if we, as a generation, choose to continue creating new looks so frequently that we do it with a much more conscience way, utilizing things such as thrift stores, upcycling, or simply only purchasing from brands that we have researched and feel good about wearing. Lastly, I feel it is important to recognize that not every American has the economic freedom to simply stop buying cheaply made goods. Ultimately, I think it still comes down to the basic concept of reducing the clothes that one person owns. No one person has any reason to be purchasing 60 new items of clothing per year.

Watching “The True Cost” left me in tears. I am furious, but also deeply sad. I honestly hate the society we live in, we unconsciously are shaped to believe that consumerism leads to happiness, thus we buy trendy things that we don’t need and end up throwing them away without even thinking about the work behind it.  It was shocking to learn that the US has produced 11 million tons of textile! We live in a society where the economy is all about making profit, and big corporations have proven to ignore the basic guidelines to ensure a fair treatment to producers and suppliers. We rarely hear about the impact that oil companies have on our environment, let alone the fact that fashion industries are the second most polluting industry in the world and they are NOT being accounted for all the damage they’ve done. 
  <br><br>
On one side we have the product waste, as I mentioned before it is about 1 million tons of non biodegradable textiles, which takes about 200 years to degrade, while releasing harmful chemicals and producing greenhouse gases. On the other side, there’s the cost of the resources and the labor. Cotton growth involves the use of pesticides that not only contaminate the soil, but also affect the communities around the agricultural lands. As we see in the documentary, kids are being born with retardation, along with others having dermal conditions anywhere in the body. It’s a chain, and the more we contaminate soil the more chemicals we’ll need to harvest. 
  <br><br>
Similarly, there’s the labor factor. Garment workers, mostly concentrated in Bangladesh, are being exploited to make US clothes. People literally dedicate their lives for us !! I know it is pretty obvious, someone has to make the clothes but it’s just insane to me all the hardships and struggle they go through. More than 1000 people have died due to poor conditions they work in. We have to make a change ! Yes, we heard that the problem is within the system and unless it is taken seriously, nothing will change, but I believe that we alone can contribute to the change. We choose to buy, and for this I feel guilty because I, myself, never thought about it but if we start questioning the fashion industry and turning to alternative consumerism that has less impact on our environment, we can help to at least open debate for their actions. Human consumption empowers these companies, thus we share the guilt.

After watching this movie the fact that stuck with me was that the fashion industry is the second largest chemical producer in the world. In current discourse surrounding climate change and climate justice, the fashion industry is never brought up into the conversation. I have many friends who consider themselves environmentalists, and yet always seem to have a package waiting for them at the front door. The ideas expressed in this film should be much more public, and we as a society should be more aware of what makes these products cheap. 
  <br><br>
Seeing the stories and personal insights of the workers was especially powerful. As american consumers, we often see the “made in china” tag or some other country and understand that it is made there because it is cheaper. That is where the thought process stops however. We never think about what makes it cheaper and the conditions and pay that these workers are forced to accept to make these cheaper products.

In watching “The True Cost,” I totally agree with your argument that Americans tend not to think much about the tags on their clothes. It’s really unfortunate that, even when tragedy strikes like with what happened in Rana Plaza, the social effects remain temporary. That story dominated the news for weeks and drew the attention of millions to the plight of garment workers. At the same time, the industry did not change at all in response and profits remained unaffected (in fact, profits were at a record high the following year). As much as we discuss social change, I tend to believe that a unifying event, even and especially a negative one, will drive that change. In this case though, it’s hard to imagine a more tragic story and yet progress still failed.


<br><hr>

Just like you, the idea that our fashion industry is the second largest chemical producer in the world is absurd. The chemicals used to dye, treat and manufacture clothing has serious environmental and economic impacts that we rarely acknowledge. Clothes are essential to most of our cultures but that does not mean we cannot sustainably make our clothing without outsourcing and overuse of chemical byproducts. The idea of environmentally safe and ethically produced clothing is something that is growing but the truth is we should have found a safe, reliable way of making clothes from the beginning. Soon we will run out of the resources these companies took for granted and only then will we finally start looking for more sustainable clothing options.

<br><hr>
I am completely agree with what you have said. It is true when we ask someone what may worse the climate change, people would never say that fashion industries would be the one, not to mention that fashion industries is the second most polluting industry in the world. Also, the most impressive part of it is about the labor force that work for these fashion industries. In order to provide affordable clothes for human beings and make huge profits, they find cheap labor and shamelessly cut their wage to “$3” per day. The fashion companies try to make excessive profits by no means. For those workers, they even afraid of being sick. Why? If they are sick, no-one can support their family, and they don’t have money to cure themselves. Sick means no less death to them. It’s horrible to know all those details that how fashion companies are making money, and how “much” they did for climate change, like recycle clothes only recycle their tags. It really hilarious when I watched it, and these companies deceive consumers and use any resources to make profit.

I think a great way to spread the message of the harm that comes from fast fashion is to use social media. As of now, social media makes anything a trend, even consumerism. However, if we can spread the idea of minimalism or expose the damaging effects of fast fashion through social media, maybe social media would not be all that bad. The fact that more people are familiar with the "you know I had to do it to em" meme more than fast fashion effects is crazy, but telling. If something so random and so funny can be circulated and talked about so much, why can't truly detrimental problems like fast fashion circulate. Even the coronavirus has become a meme that every knows. In fact, I learned about the corona virus not through the news, but through social media. Most people are told what to like, laugh at, and care about through social media. Another way that we can use social media for good is to get celebrities or youtubers to promote sustainable shopping. They are adding to the problem by promoting brands and should use their voice for good and promote sources of clothing that are less harmful like thrift shopping. I think this has taken effect slightly as I have seen people talking more about thrifting clothes and its benefits. If this can be popularized the fast fashion industry will have to supply less with a reducing demand. It is up to us to reduce demand and not give into their tricks to making us consumers.

After watching “The True Cost,” I was absolutely horrified. While I knew of the terrible conditions of sweatshops, I don’t think I had truly realized the true horror of these workers’ lives. I believe this documentary does an excellent job highlighting the dangerous life of a sweatshop worker, as well as diving into the manipulative culture of fast fashion and big industries. 

  <br><br>

The conditions of sweatshops are inhumane; nobody should be treated any less than human, however, many textile workers in third-world countries are treated terribly. As shown in the documentary, many people seem to “brush off” the idea that these labor conditions are this bad, claiming that the workers are the ones putting themselves in these positions, as they are the ones “choosing” to work. This privileged state of mind is honestly so hard to hear; while people are technically choosing to work, the jobs are often the most abundant employment opportunities (for a given talent/expertise) and workers must support their families. They are not choosing the awful working conditions, but rather are forced into them if they want to make a living and survive. The heartbreaking (and ironic) truth is that they may not survive.

  <br><br>

While this documentary did not focus on the disastrous environmental impacts of fast fashion, it did highlight the power of big corporations. On an environmental platform, efforts of huge industries, like that of fossil fuel and fast fashion, often outweigh attempts to save the planet, as they only care about economic profit to their companies. Unfortunately, in today’s society, the idealization of immense wealth and economic strength seems to allow the awful treatment of both people and our planet, and we must find a way to stop it.

I agree with everything that Leah mentioned. Even though "The True Cost" does not focus too much on the environment it did talk a lot about the safety (or lack there of) of the workers in these textile factories. I understand that some people do not believe in climate change and that is their own opinion, regardless or not if I agree with it. What I do not understand is how some people are so ignorant, selfish, and privileged to not see that the conditions that these textile workers are working in are completely unacceptable. There were so many moments throughout the documentary where I found myself getting extremely frustrated at those who acted oblivious to this horrific problem. People are dying in these third world countries while making the clothes that we wear on our backs. I find that absolutely disgusting. I feel like the big problem is that many people are not aware that this is an ongoing issue. We must spread awareness so that people begin paying more attention to what they are buying, where they are buying it from, and where it was made.


<br><hr>
Just like you, the most shocking and disturbing thing that I heard during "The True Cost" were the people who truly believed that the conditions aren't that bad because these people are choosing to work here. Just because someone chooses to work somewhere doesn't mean that they should have to work in such inhumane ways. It's hard to see some privileged people who think that it's okay to treat people like that and not have a care in the world about their safety, only the profit. Many of the women in Bangladesh don't have a choice, they must provide for themselves and their family and unfortunately, these sweatshops, hire the most employees. 
  <br><br>


Even though the film didn't address the environmental impacts as much as I was expecting, it highlighted our problem with capitalism and consumerism and how much people are expecting cheap clothes without realizing the other side of how much did it cost to make the shirt, and more importantly how little was the person who made it paid. I am definitely guilty of this sometimes, as I like to get clothes that are cheap because I never really understood or justified spending a lot of money on clothing. However, now I have found a reason. To help support those people who get paid at a normal wage instead of the horrible conditions of the sweatshops.

  <br><br>

In response to Ken's question of who is to blame for all of this consumption, I would agree with Thoreau, that it is the industry's fault. The industry is so focused on profit and profit and that's it, they need to take a step back and focus on their customers and their employees.

I honestly haven't been this angry over a documentary until "The True Cost". Don't get me wrong, "The Climate of Doubt" was an extremely difficult film to get through, but at least with those deniers, you can make fun of them and get your satisfaction from proving them wrong, but with this one...it is not the same shade of angry that I got from seeing the Heartland Institute, but more like despair and lost from seeing people in third world countries operating in sweatshops. Before even watching this, I was very familiar with the argument that people in third world countries are benefiting from sweatshops because it is a job that they could do to earn a wage; instead of working in the field as laborers. Thus, the Western Market has given them new, better opportunities. I am ashamed to admit that this is a view that I too have had that view until I stepped foot in this class. Yes, although it is true that their standards are different than ours, that doesn't make it appropriate to subject them to such low living conditions. Hell, some dogs in the West have much better lives than those people in Bangladesh. What also really got to me was how some companies began to monopolize GMOs that act as pesticides just to screw over the poor farmers, who already poor as is and only have their land as the source in income.  Since the GMOs often fail, farmers then have to result back to pesticides (the products of those companies), and pesticides cause birth defects and medical issues of which the farmers have to buy medicines ( the product of those companies) to cure their kids. The more money the farmers have to spend on those companies the more he owes them and the cycle continues until they come to take his land as a repayment. It makes me mad how far they are willing to go just for money. But I don't think the companies are the problems. I think they started the movement as a catalyst, and we as consumers just took it and ran. Yeah, they might have inspired us to buy things with their advertisements, but in reality, the choice of consumption is entirely ours. We buy because it is trendy, or to feel good, or just to fit in. But we still buy and thus they still have the means to produce. And if we want more and more they will produce more and more, and be willing to cut more and more corners to supply us. Thus, there will be more and more women working in poor conditions struggling to satisfy our demands. And this is just the human condition. What we are doing to the planet is much worse by pumping out chromium from leather companies and then fast fashion just means fast waste that is non-biodegradable. Solution? idk, buy less or something, and maybe thousands of people in sweatshops might have higher lifespans and not be worried about collapsing buildings. Like don't you just hate it when you are working for barely enough to support yourself and the whole entire building just falls?

When did morals leave the chat? Can you imagine what a country would look like if it didn’t run with capitalism driving every damn avenue, industry and mind? I can imagine that there would be a whole lot more happy people. While I understand that these people do need jobs that can support them financially (not entirely), this cannot be seen as the best option. It hurt me to hear scholars actually argue that these slave-like conditions in countries abroad are necessary to run our own country. How did we diminish our American made brands so quickly? What ever happened to American pride in things we produce locally. If everyone could compare the joy of buying organic vegetables from their local farmers’ markets, to the joy of buying clothing from local producers, we would not be to blame for thousands of lives lost to poor working conditions in poor countries. Shame on us.

The True Cost was very eye opening. It really shows the effect consumer culture has, and the multiple fields it impacts, including the environment. I was disgusted by the treatment of many workers whose work is exploited and their safety and well-being is not considered. That being said, I was somewhat impressed with companies like Patagonia who want their customers to address that they are indeed consuming. It was upsetting but not surprising that all major retail companies declined to be interviewed. This just shows me how they know the dirty things that happen in their business and don't want to be held accountable for them. The lack of response seems guilty to me. 
  <br><br>
This movie also brought my attention to how it isn't really the consumers who are forcing companies to make this fast fashion due to such high demand. In reality, it is the companies using their money to instill a demand in people in order to make people feel like they need to consume so heavily and quickly. I always thought that it was the consumers who have forced businesses to be able to keep producing for the ever-changing demands of the public, but instead it is the companies that change small things that the public don't even need but market it in a way that makes the public feel like they need to buy.
  <br><br>
In my life, I have always bought clothes that I think will last for a while, because I don't really like shopping. This movie opened my eyes to the societal norm of shopping an insane amount without care for how long it lasts. These companies cater to this norm and promote it so intensely, which is frightening.

I’m truly disgusted. It seems like a common theme throughout this course is to feel guilty for your past actions. We need this Great Awakening though. Although 2020 will mark almost 4 years of completely shopping secondhand, I cannot believe I once participated and contributed to such an industry. It sickens me to my core that this is the world we live in. Collapsing buildings, poisoned land, contaminated water, vicious killings following strikes. Where will it stop? When will it end? We need more people to see this film. We need more Leonardo DiCaprios in this world. More people with influence need to use it in a positive way that actually spreads a message effectively. This film has motivated me to jump into action and want to help desperate people in Cambodia, Haiti, Bangladesh, and India. What else can I do other than continue my boycott of fast fashion? This course has opened my eyes to the abilities of student change on a college campus. I applied for a position with the Isla Vista Trading Post that promotes the use of recycled clothing items and helps eliminate the stigma of sporting previously used clothes. I owe a lot of my inspiration to act on this issue to this Climate Crisis course and the unique format of discussion-based learning. Thanks, Ken!

I totally agree with you, this documentary blew my mind. I never realized the extent of what buying cheap clothing does on the various producers in other countries. It makes me sick to my stomach. The fact that I never had even heard of the Raza Plaza disaster helped put the travesties off fast fashion into an even greater perspective because not only are we putting people through terrible working conditions with low wages, but we also aren’t even hearing about a thousand people dying. That is ridiculous how cut off we are from how terrible fast fashion is. The Raza Plaza disaster should have been worldwide breaking news that gave further insight into what is going on in the fashion industry. It scares me that after this disaster, still nothing was done to stop fast fashion production and help the conditions and livelihood of the workers working for big companies. At what point will we be like yeah, that’s pretty terrible, maybe we should fix this? Over 1000 people have died in the fashion industry.. It’s one of the most dangerous industries to be in, are you kidding me? People are dying all so we can have a new top to wear, what, maybe twice? It’s ridiculous. I’m so mad and sad and devastated at us for not fixing what is going on and feel awful for the people who slave day by day to create stupid pieces of clothing. I agree with you that major change needs to be taken to fix this, but I feel like it's only getting worse. Clothing is only getting cheaper and cheaper, people are wanting to own more and more pieces of it, and the population continues to grow each year. I am fearful and sad for everyone going through what our industry has out you through and I know I can’t do much, but I will do my part in buying sustainably and with fairtrade.

It is impressive how you have been secondhand shopping for four consecutive years now. Like you, I also felt remorseful and ashamed when looking back at the numerous times I have made a purchase at Forerver21 or H&M. Nonetheless, in the past few years, there was been a growing trend of the youth going into thrift shops to purchase vintage items that are affordable and sustainable. I believe that the case of this trend has been for the online presence of thrift shop hauls posted on YouTube. Undoubtedly, the youth is being influenced to look into alternative ways to shop for trendy clothing pieces. As a result, fast fashion companies such as Forever21 have declared bankruptcy because the youth is no longer buying their cheap products. This is a good first step in the right direction.

I think both consumers and the manufactories have something to do with fast fashion, however, just as the movie mentions, it is the system that causes the real problem. In my opinion, people that want to buy a cheap product is because of the lack of money. If they have more money, I believe they all willing to buy better clothes. The companies all want to make a better profit, in order to profit more, they just pay less to their employees. The fewer salaries are, the higher the possibility for them to buy a cheaper product. It's like a cycle within the whole economic system. If someone wants to solve this problem, I think he/she should look at the economic system first, there must be something wrong with it. Besides the system, I think it's time for us to rethink our concept of spending money. Sometimes when we see one cloth is on sale, we will automatically want to buy that, even though we don't like it that much, or even we won't wear it, we still want to pay for it. It's a kind of waste not only of the product but also a waste of the labor behind it. It's time for us to think about do we really need that many clothes? Or we just want to satisfy ourselves?

The film The True Cost shocks me in the way it depicted the whole story and the story is told. Living in an era of fast fashion, we’ve enjoyed a lot in cheap clothing and all kinds of low-price items. We are getting used to the current fast fashion shopping style. But if we consider what if the true cost behind the commercial process to make the products so cheap? We can find out that the true cost behind the cheap products in prosperous cities in the cost of labor, cost of sweatshops, cost of capital, cost of lands, and cost of the environment in the poorest areas in our world. The fast-fashion company makes people feel we become rich because we can afford to buy lots of new items, but it is actually making people poorer, and overall the only one that getting richer is the fast-fashion company. In order to squeeze the costs, the owners paid no attention of the unsafe structure of factories, ignoring the big cracks on the factory building, causing thousands of people die of that. Profits make people don’t take people’s lives seriously. Profit simply drives people crazy. Human rights are ignored when people concentrate in making more profits. As clothes in the fast fashion era become disposable products, tons of clothes become parts of landfills annually. A lot of the textures are not able to discompose, and all the chemicals released from the textures are obviously harmful to the local environment. In poor areas, a lot of people devote their lives to making the product for Europeans and Americans to make money, but they also suffer the most from the era. 
<br><br>
 It is pretty emotionally impactful, at least for me. I feel I need to change my consumption value after watching this documentary. I didn’t think of buying one more clothes could cause more damage to other people and other places. I apologize for that and want to call for attention on the issue we are facing today. Let’s treat people human-like, not treat them profit-making-like.

It was horrifying and disgusting how managers ignored the poor working conditions that led to the death of more than a thousand during the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013, despite receiving multiple concerned protests from the workers. It was even more disgusting to hear how people justified the robbery of essential human rights by claiming that these workers "had no better alternatives". One interviewee claimed that there was nothing intrinsically dangerous about sewing clothes -- completely ignoring the situation and working conditions that people are in. Another guy said that sweatshops only look bad to wealthy people in America because we are comparing it to what we have here. That's just wrong. Sweatshops look bad anywhere to anyone, not just to wealthy Americans. The workers there may be choosing to work in these factories as opposed to other options, but they are definitely not choosing the horrible, neglected conditions of the factories. Simply brushing the problem of corrupt management aside and justifying sweatshops by saying these workers have no other choice is inhumane.

I honestly find it appalling how people are getting treated for financial gain. It really sickens me that the companies found a loophole by not owning the factories so they are not responsible for anything that happens to the employees. They've also made those third world countries NEED them in order to maintain their own economy. These countries are in fear of losing the factory or else their people would be in a deeper hole than they're in now. Those people are really getting paid dirt compared to how much the companies really make. As a decent human being I really don't understand how this is being allowed. How people in other countries are suffering because of our demand for new clothes. Our materialistic ways are literally killing people and many people aren't even aware of it. These giant companies not only take advantage of workers but also take advantage of the consumers by either making the clothes cheap that will not last or use advertisements that show happiness stems from materialism which really is not the case. Money really brings out the worst in people. There should be regulation on these types of things because that would not be allowed in America. Why should American companies outsource to other countries to take advantage of those people whose rights aren't protected?

“The True Cost” I must say is one of the most depressing films I have ever seen. I did not go into the film with the thought of my being heartbroken by the end of it. I have not felt like such a way in a long time. I didn’t know that the fashion industry had such a detrimental impact on our world, not just economically, but also ethically. This eminent disaster didn’t start to occur until after the 60’s. In the 1960’s, the U.S. was making 95% of our clothing. Today, it’s now shockingly 3%, while the other 97% is from outsourced, under-developed countries. Workers from these countries are placed in harsh working conditions. Some of these conditions were so harsh that it caused the lives of many to be lost. For example, the collapse of the 8 story building in Bangladesh which killed about 1000 workers, many of which were young girls, which is what saddened me the most. The fashion industry doesn’t give a damn about the lives of others. The only thing they care about is which deal (i.e. which third world country will work for the cheapest) will give them the biggest bang for their buck. 
<br><br>
The fashion industry has expanded so much as time has proceeded. It’s what our culture revolves around. The fashion industry is growing so fast that natural resources aren’t able to keep up. This is why the fashion industry began to organically reengineer plants, such as cotton, so they could keep up. This is where the seed business begins to take over. A monopoly is created which soon ruins the lives of millions. For example, the monopoly business of GM seeds was selling their products at astronomical values which farmers could not suffice. This in turn led to farmers’ lands being claimed by this industry, which shockingly led to the suicides of over 250,000 farmers in the last 16 years. That’s right, 250,000 farmer suicides, that’s the “...largest recorded wave of suicide in history.” There are other parts of the world where people are still dying, and it’s not due to suicides, but by cancers and other illnesses caused by harmful chemicals from the fashion industry. It’s just not fair. It’s so sad seeing all these innocent lives being taken away by an industry that we’re so selfish about. All these people want to do is live a decent life, that’s all, nothing more, yet our fashion industry treats them like nothing, but slaves. 
<br><br>
It sucks that all our economy is based on is materialism, which in itself is bad for us human beings as a society, but good for us in terms of the economy. I was oddly surprised to see the lady from India that hadn’t seen her parents in a year seem so happy. I don’t know how any could live such a miserable life (in my opinion) and still be happy as if she’s grateful for another day of being alive. But then it clicked. You don’t need materialistic things to keep you happy. As I’ve said before, “It’s much deeper than that”. Happiness isn’t something that you can just buy or own, it is acquired from the things that you genuinely love and cherish.

I also agree with you that the “True Cost,” a very upsetting film; it was the most upsetting  film that I have seen in class so far. The fashion industry is literally killing people for the purpose of profit, with no regard at all for human life. One of the most upsetting moments in the film was when Shima Akher, a garment worker from Dakha was saying that the clothing made by the factories in Bangladesh are being made by “our blood,” and simply wishes that nothing is made by the blood of others.
<br><br>
I did not know how impactful the fashion industry is globally, that it is the most labour dependent industry in the world. Though I know that the fashion industry is part of global capitalism, I did not know that ⅙ people in the world work in some part of the global fashion industry. My brother and I were watching a youtube video on the richest people in the world and the CEO on H&M was among the top richest people in the world, and I wondered, “How could this be?” After watching this film, it is not surprising to me anymore. Like any other product that we consume, we don’t really think about the process of clothing manufacturing  and the economics behind it.
<br><br>
I also agree with you that I hate the way our economy is structured. A capitalist economy, it seems from what we have seen in the class, is unsustainable and dangerous for not only those who exist in the third world, but simply anyone who is not a capitalist. The professor asks the question, who is to blame for consumerism- the consumers or the corporations? By individualizing the problem and blaming the consumers, we overlook systemic factors, such as a capitalist dependent economy, and blame workers for choosing the jobs that they use, such as how a CEO in the film stated they garment workers choose their own job.
<br><br>
There is a very large gap in the relationship between the workers and the clothing they produce. A common critique of capitalism is something termed as “alienation.” Alienation is something that occurs as a result of the intense demands of capitalism. Essentially, the worker becomes “alienated” from the product that they have produced, because the main goal is the creation of the product for the most profit. The worker’s relationship with the product is diminished because they have no say in how the product is produced, or their relationship with the product, which also includes safe working conditions.

You worded this so well. I was so shocked and speechless and hopeless after this film. Truly is the worst of humanity. Being an economics major we always look at how outsourcing is good for both economies, but it is so important to look at if we are truly making the world a better place, or just feeding the problems that keep us privileged. How can this be ignored and how is this not talked about all the time? 
<br><br>


The suicide of farmers and the consequences of being around all those chemicals is for fashion. If this keeps progressing were not going to have farmers in the US especially not organic or chemical-free farms. Bringing up the importance of what it is you are putting on your body and condoning into the world is such an important conversation. Fashion is so not worth all those lives. When one of the ladies said that she doesn't think anyone should be wearing clothes made at the cost of blood that really stuck with me. Especially since that piece of clothing is so temporary and insignificant to the person who bought it for 5$, while it means inequality, abuse, injury, and sometimes death for another person. 'The True Cost' was such an appropriate name because that shirt does not really cost 10$ it cost so much more.
<br><hr>

I wanted to respond to this comment because I also was extremely upset by what I saw in this film. Though I knew that fast fashion has a bad impact on our environment seeing the faces behind it all is a different experience. It’s shocking to see just how bad and unethical this entire practice is. Its even more shocking that the people (mostly young women) have no rights. How could this be? As you and the film have pointed out we only make 3% of our clothing and the rest is all out sourced. This is because our society has become so accustomed to cheap clothing. I am no exception to this. For so long I have always gotten clothes that have been cheap because that is what I expect. Like Ken has mentioned in so many videos it is essential that we change our cultural practices. I agree that one of the most emotional parts was learning about the 8-story building that collapsed killing 1000 people. I had no knowledge of this prior to watching the video. Learning about this makes me emotional because if I had a better understanding about how unethical fast fashion is I would never want to participate. This video puts a human face on fast fashion. 
<br><br>

With the shocking events that have happened in Bangladesh I found it disgusting that those that are part of the fast fashion industry still stand in support of outsourcing. For example, Kate Ball Young is a former sourcing manager responds to sweat shops by exampling that it doesn’t bother her that there are people working in these conditions because “They’re doing a job. There are a lot worse things that they can be doing”. This was a disgusting display or negligence and greed. For someone that has first hand knowledge of the conditions and the circumstances surrounding sweatshops and to make public claims that they are the better option is shocking. I don’t think those working in sweat shops would agree with this. The men and women working in sweatshops do so because they have not other options and are given no rights. Like you said these people just want to live decent life. It is frustrating to me that those in power don’t care about any of this. 
<br><br>


I am also disappointed that this is our current reality. The Waste Makers clearly outlines how our economy depends on the willingness of people to keep buying. Reading this before watching the film gave me a better point of reference on how we even got here in the first place. This has been years in the making and as our population continues to grow it’s only going to be getting worse. This explains why 3 of the 4 worst tragedies in fast fashion history have happened in the last year. I give this film 5 star because it puts into perspective what we, as consumers are encouraging. I never again want to contribute to fast fashion again. Thank you Ken for having this film is part of our class.

In the film, it criticizes the fashion industry and argues the true cost behind our daily wearing style and what we have done to our environment along the way that we pursuit beauties. 

<br><br>

At the beginning of the film, it introduces a new concept of fashion, the “fast fashion”, which is kind of fashion that being invented for a short period of time and will soon be replaced by other fashions. I am astonished about this, especially when I heard that there are new fashions coming every week. I never realized a fashion can be produced in such short amount of time and it can also go obsolete that fast. With this productivity, it can fit the need of consumerism and let consumers to buy different clothing every week. This can serve as a stimulant to let other products to loss their value, and cost more people to buy new stuffs instead of using the old ones. Just think about the amount of pollution it can release to the environment. 
<br><br>


The other cost that was mentioned by the video is the “cut corners” in the production business, because the need of the goods increased, and the market became more and more competitive, many factories now need to reduce their production cost. As a consequence, the workers in the factories are under danger due to the limited gear needed to protect them. 
<br><br>
After watching this, I think it is necessary for us to lower our consumption, both for the workers and our environment.

Throughout the course, there has been an underlying cause that shows up with each and every topic we cover: the first-world consumer. In "The True Cost," the documentary points out the outrageous affects that the fast fashion industry is having on the planet. In fact, it is second most environmentally damaging industry, second only to the oil industry. In addition to the harmful effects on the environment, the documentary also spent a lot of time discussing the industry's affect on the workers in developing countries. The workers are exploited for their cheap labor and lack of rights. The scene where they showed the worker's march in Cambodia for better working conditions and better pay was powerful and deeply unsettling. Seeing the workers beat to the ground over basic human rights and my access to cheap clothing made me greatly reconsider the clothes and products that I really need and what companies I'm buying from and giving my money to. 
<br><br>


We as consumers collectively are in a powerful position to make a change to this incredibly wasteful industry. Minimize the amount of stuff we buy, and when we do buy things, support brands like Patagonia and People Tree that are environmentally-minded. I've never really understood the fad with companies like Forever 21 because the quality is always minimal and the products never last. Supporting fast fashion companies is putting workers in developing countries in poor circumstances and is coincidentally making us poorer, too.

It was very shocking to watch the interview with the woman in Bangladesh. I was impressed by how optimistic she was at the beginning of the interview. When she talked about how workers in Bangladesh had to bear with low income and forced to work overtime, when she said that “there is no limit to the struggle of Bangladeshi workers”, she was smiling and seemed to be holding on. However, when she mentioned the Rana Plaza accident, she started breaking down and couldn’t control herself. I could see the fear in her and the uncertainty in her life. The workers were treated so badly that they would never know if they could come back at night when they left home for work. The woman was so desperate for a change in her life but there was nothing she could do to fight back (except trying to raise people’s awareness and pray for them to spread the word).

In watching “The True Cost” I learned that third world countries and the environment are both negatively affected by the fashion industry. Often times I have read the labels on my clothing and realized that none of the items I wore were made locally in the United States, but I did not think much of it. Until having watched this film I realized why that is. Western countries like the one we live in would rather have clothing made elsewhere in the world because it's cheaper to make the products while paying workers less. This phenomenon of global production is what keeps those third world countries poor. In a sense, I kinda figured all this was going on behind the scenes of how we obtain cheap clothing in our country but I did not know the seriousness and the degree it had gone to over the years. The environmental impacts of consumerism is a topic I was completely unaware of. I have now learned that the cotton plant is reengineered to keep up with the clothes being massively produced. Cotton seeds are being genetically modified, creating a seed monopoly. One might think this is not a big deal but it really is. The chemicals in fertilizers and pesticides are contaminating the soil. This contamination is leading to birth defects, cancer, and mental illness in poor countries when in contact with the genetically modified cotton. This issue is on the consumer to blame. If we as consumers were not so materialistic than nature and third world countries would not be dying slowly in the way that they are. The way consumerism is presented is both very educational as well as entertaining. There are so many jaw-dropping facts stated, many of which I was completely unaware of.

Watching this film has giving me a whole new perspective, on the fashion industry and even on the clothes I wear, and I never knew how toxic the fashion industry was to not only people but to the environment as well. This documentary really made me rethink about all the clothing I have bought and will continue to buy. I think what really hurt me the most was seeing the people in third world countries suffer on our behalf, watching these people working in these inhumane conditions just to survive and make a decent living. Overall, this film showed me how greedy and blindsided most Americans are, we do not care about what the cost will be as long as we look good or we are number one, and that sucks knowing we live in a world where we only prioritize ourselves. I learned a lot of new things watching this documentary, for one I did not know that clothing was the second highest thing that caused pollution, after oil and that really shocked me, because even though I do donate a large portion of my used clothing to charity, a lot of that still ends up as waste. I thought it was very informational and eye opening especially for those like me who didn't know much about the fashion industry and how much it effects the world, even my roommates were engaged in this film while I was watching it.

I agree with you that this film has been truly eye-opening for me; discovering the truth is difficult and upsetting, but that's only because we've never been told before about the actual consequences of garment production; if everyone had seen the poor conditions in those factories in less-developed countries, they'd surely think twice before they purchase. 
<br><br>
I once came across a Primark in Berlin that sold really cheap and nice-looking shirts; though not a huge buyer by any means, I was inclined to add a few items to my shopping list. Now I feel quite a bit guilty when I imagine the amount of waste and toxicity that goes into clothing, as well as the people who've had to suffer the bare minimum working conditions. In the U.S., the fashion industry has become the trendsetting norm, and many so-called "cosmetic influencers" such as the Kardashians are making so much money from promoting their products; even ordinary folks look up to Instagrammers who buy way more than they should and perceive them as the "hip and cool" standard. If anything, watching "The True Cost" has made me feel more adamant about practicing minimalism, buying clothes only when absolutely necessary, and staying away from wasteful consumerism.

In the documentary, The True Cost, I was both shocked yet also unsurprised at the “true cost” of the consumerism that has taken over our society, especially in the sense of fast fashion. With my parents being from India, I was already aware of the cheap materials being available in Southern Asia, just as Bangladesh was shown extensively in this film. Since labor is so cheap in many countries like Bangladesh and Cambodia, the true colors of capitalism shine brightly in the pursuit of maxing out profits. Brands like Zara and H&M see the hottest styles from American media and it’s a race to try and capitalize on the hype by creating cheaper clones in mass production. Even brands like Nike, which aren’t known for being “fast fashion” we’re just recently under fire for their use of child-labor and inhuman manufacturing. However, I was still shocked when I found out that the governments of these countries are actually “inviting” such companies over in order to generate business and jobs. However, they were also known to keep wages low and use militant force to dispel and unions or strikes occurring, almost as if the government was trying to profit off of its people like a king.

In terms of the Patriot Act episode, I think it is a much more presentable format for people of my generation. Not everyone has the time to watch multiple documentaries that each span an hour or two, and still be able to retain all the information needed. The shorter, more condensed information of the Patriot Act really does bring the audience in, especially since there is an element of humor and relatability that he provides. I had already seen the episode simply because I was a fan of Hasan Minhaj himself, and I can say that his other episodes are just as effective in getting to the point.

It is disgusting that Americans spend 1.1 TRILLION dollars during the holiday season on clothes and get a "physical high" from shopping. What the actual fuck is wrong with us? The AVERAGE american buys SIXTY-EIGHT new pieces of clothing PER YEAR. That is five to six new items per month. Fast fashion is absolutely disgusting and is contributing so much to our carbon footprint. Not only is it wasteful to buy clothes and not wear them, but it is terrible for our environment. Not to mention the near slave-wage labor that people are paid to make these clothes, nor the automation that fast fashion companies are using, which is destroying good-paying jobs and our economy. Fast fashion is so unnecessary. We as Americans should thrift shop as much as possible, donate our clothes to Goodwill, or give them to our friends or family. To be honest, I go to Savers and Goodwill as much as I go to the mall. I love it. It's fun!! Not to mention the cool retro styles that you can revamp.
<br><br>


As I watched "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion", I listened closely to Hasan speak. (I love Patriot Act, so this was exciting to sit down and watch). One thing he said really stood out to me. He talked about the music video for Cardi B's "I Like It", and quoted the lyric "I like those Balenciagas, the ones that look like socks"-- ugly shoes that look like socks, that retail for 800 dollars. Hasan then describes a fast fashion company's knockoff version that they sell for 60; Hasan said "you can look like a knockoff Cardi B for sixty bucks". The amount of people shopping Name Brand or knock offs trying to pretend they are name brand are ridiculous. They shouldn't care so much about being trend-followers. They're lame. Be original!

After watching the documentary, "The True Cost", I began to reconsider the stores that I shop at. It is hard to consider the behind-the-scenes organization that come with the fast fashion industry as most of its production is done in countries that are so far away, like Bangladesh. One thing that I found extremely insensitive and borderline offensive is when a relatively well-off woman was interviewed in the documentary about how sweatshops are not as bad as they seem. Her reasoning was that these people "choose to work" at these sweatshops, so they know what is coming for them. She also stated that sewing clothes all day is one of the less dangerous jobs compared to others, therefore, the people in sweatshops really have no immediate dangers that could make their work life as horrible as people say it is. I just think that this comment was extremely ignorant and in some ways, victim blaming. I don't know whether she has experienced first hand being in a sweatshop for her to say this, but it doesn't take a genius to know that conditions can be hot, humid, mentally and physically demanding, and most of all unfair. I found myself feeling really defensive when that woman spoke about her opinion. However, it is also ironic for me to defend the harshness of the sweatshops when I am still purchasing from fast fashion stores like H&M, Uniqlo, Forever21, and more. So, I think after this documentary, I will be more aware of what I buy, how much I buy, and where I buy it from.

I too started  researching ways to find out the conditions of how and where my clothing is made. They don't make it easy. Since this film, I've decided to stop shopping at H&M, Forever 21, and Nike...Which are all in my top ten places to shop at...Making decisions like this aren't at all easy...especially on my wallet..but I feel a lot of peace knowing I don't support how cheap (and some brands aren't even cheap) clothing is made. I too was angered by the woman's comment that "it is the least dangerous job..." (which we know isn't true when looking at the women who were locked inside their building during a fire and an eventual building collapse). There are stories like these all over the world. One book in particular, "We're all fast food workers now" does a great job at exposing companies and working conditions of people all over the world. This is something I plan on digging into and researching!
<br><hr>
 I see we both felt a sense of insensitivity from that interview. The way she had pointed toward the option of "choice" to these workers shows she doesn't understand the way these workers can't really just leave these inhumane work environments. If she maybe used Americanized standards for clothing production I can partially see the reasoning she had, but it just doesn't make sense for most fast fashion stores. In the end, I now see the effects that fast fashion has on the environment and I too will be more aware of what, how, and where I buy my clothes from.

The film “True Cost” shows how our actions as consumers reflect throughout the world because without consumers, big brands won’t have a business and thus, creating an environment that produces less waste. Watching the film made me realizes the tactics of business owners and how their advertisements really know how to appeal to the public. One saying in the film was “as we buy more, we become poorer and the business owners become richer” and I never thought deeply about how our choices of buying something that we want or need affects the environment. I was shocked to see how the fashion industry changed so much throughout the years where four seasons of clothing became fifty-two seasons, representing one new season for a week throughout the year. I rarely go shopping in stores nowadays because everything is so accessible online and you don’t even have to go outside and drive to the mall. This shows how companies think throughout so they can earn more consumers by appealing to the laziness of people. I think it’s a smart tactic with all their advertisements but due to the constant new seasons, people have accumulated so many pieces of clothing that they no longer wear because it is last season. This causes an abundant amount of unused clothing and they are all dumped to third world countries because we no longer want it. 
<br><br>

There was a part in the film where a fashion designer came to the factories to invite one woman to see the Paris fashion show next season but I think that’s so disrespectful because she knows that because of the Paris Fashion show, many new items of clothing are being produced but more than half of the clothing are being thrown away because the fashion industry tells the consumers what they need to buy in order to be considered “in-style”. Then, she goes around making more fashion items when she should recycle the materials from older pieces of clothing to start a new trend where people will start to think twice about buying more clothing to add to their pile of clothing already. In Haiti, there are piles of clothing that aren’t in use and I think fashion designers should start a concept where they make new trendy items with old clothing so they have more of an impact on the world instead of sitting there like trash.

I completely agree with you, with the fashion industry as striking example capitalism and consumerism dictate our spending behaviours nowadays. Rather than thinking do I really need this for utility purposes we buy stuff because we want to buy stuff. The industries have created a fake link between our sense of what we like and buying things. We have been tricked into thinking more stuff will make us happier. Converting our money into stuff as if we are zombies, it is almost as if we are on drugs. Not to speak about our 'role models' people we see online that are the best example of how consumerism work. In their Louis Vuitton jackets and Balenciaga shoes they will tell us money doesn't equal happiness, while simultaneously sending the complete opposite message. Our whole culture revolves around consuming, we have been caught up the web of the industry.

 I completely agree with you, especially on the point of the immense amount of hypocrites in today's society. Similar to how some vegans say they love animals, yet hate their own species. I think practicing what you preach is extremely important, or don't preach it at all. I see nothing wrong with owning and enjoying designer clothing, but to act like you are better than someone else or form judgements of other people when you yourself engage in these activities is just an ego trap.

The True Cost not only brings to light the environmental violations that American corporations carry out, but also how they treat their laborers. Fast fashion is an unsustainable industry. Because of the demand of 52 different seasons a year, companies have tried their utmost to produce the most clothing in the cheapest manner; almost in all cases, the cheapest and fastest manner is also the most environmentally damaging and cruel to its workers. American people as a whole need to change their views on clothing ; it should be viewed as closer to luxury rather than something disposable. Fast fashion marks one more unforseen cause of climate change and one of the largest products of consumer culture. Big companies and people of wealth control the market to promote the purchase of one time use products - clothing is no different. This film brings to light yet another part of human actions that must be quickly changed in order to curb climate crisis.

Its common knowledge that sweatshops exist but I never really hear people talk about it. I think everyone knows that most of the clothes they buy are made in sweatshops, but its one of those things that people kind of ignore because its easier than buying more expensive alternatives. In the film, “The True Cost”, they mention that one in six people in the world works in the fast fashion industry. This statistic was astonishing to me, especially because most of these workers are paid pennies a day to work in awful conditions and are treated like animals. Seeing the people in charge of these large fast fashion companies talk about how they make their products was terrifying. One of the most infuriating parts of the film was when the representative from H&M was being interviewed and couldn’t even say how much they paid their workers because she knew that people would be disgusted. The craziest part of this is that the only people that are gaining anything from fast fashion are the people that are running these companies. We, as consumers, are just spending endless amounts of money on clothing that isn’t going to make us happy and that we will most likely get no use out of. Consumers have so much more power than they think. We don’t have to buy anything we don’t want to, its as simple as that. These companies are tricking us into buying these products through advertising without us even realizing it, but all it takes to take away their power is to stop and think about what you are buying. The documentary we watched last week, “Minimalism”, goes hand in hand with “The True Cost”, as it shows one solution to the fast fashion issue. The woman in “Minimalism” who cut down her closet to only 33 items, and mentioned that nobody noticed, is a perfect example of how brainwashed we are into thinking we need hundreds of items of clothing. The issue is that it's too hard to regulate advertising and the influence that these companies have. I think the solution to this is to make them more sustainable fair trade options trendy. There's a clothing company called Reformation that only creates sustainable, fair trade clothing that is growing fast. Its probably one of the most popular companies among teenage girls. All of their clothes are expensive, but girls will save up to buy one nice piece, and it will probably last them for a long time. The company is 100% carbon neutral, and they are still considering really “cool”. I think that's what the future of fashion should look like.

I really like how you linked “The True Cost” with last week’s “Minimalism” because I find adopting a more minimalist lifestyle will help combat the consequences of fast fashion. The average American throws away 82 pounds of textile waste each year! This adds up to 11 million tons of textile waste from the U.S. alone. On top of this problem, this material is typically non-biodegradable and will sit in landfills for 200+ years, contaminating our earth and releasing harmful gases in the air. Not only is this wasteful, but neglectful towards our environment. I admittedly have clothes that I don’t even wear, but have in case I ever do start to like them. This is a toxic mindset. I am nowhere near wealthy, I’m a college student who qualified for free lunch and fee waivers during high school, but even I still have excess goods. Those well-off and way stable than me most likely have plenty. It’s absurd how there are hundreds of thousands of people with too much, unsatisfied with what they have and looking for more, when there are people scraping by and not having what they need (note: need, not want). Minimalism promotes donating and sustainability, values we should uphold at a time like this.
<br><br>

I hate how difficult the structure of our society makes it to be eco-friendly. A perfect analogy is how difficult it may be to eat healthy. Say you’re on a budget, but you want to be healthy. The cheapest foods tend to be the worst for you, fast food especially being accessible over sparse pieces of lettuce coated in dressing. As you mentioned, there are clothing companies that promote sustainable, fair trade clothing and their mission is amazing! It just genuinely sucks how more expensive it is than fast fashion and in all honesty, some people cannot afford it and have to feel guilty knowing the conditions of sweatshops but not being financially capable to revolt. This reminds me of our discussion of the carbon tax. It hurts middle to low class families who need to commute to work or other errands and does not hurt companies as much. Companies who emit large quantities of CO2 and other gases may get annoyed by the carbon tax, but ultimately will make the sacrifice to keep harming our earth and most likely in turn, lay off already low-paid workers (middle to low class) to budget accordingly. This is not to undermine how middle to low class families / cars contribute negatively, considering that there are millions of cars on this earth in use, but just to point out how trapped we are.
<br><br>

Cultural changes need to be made, but also changes in how our society functions. We need to make being environmentally conscious easier and more attainable and it starts with lobbying governmental officials to pass legislation that pressures multinational corporations to comply. Not only comply to regulations regarding the environment, but to give workers better working conditions and pay! This is a class of the climate crisis, but I am sure we are all disgusted by what people have to endure and what others inflict. The trickery from companies is especially due to advertisement. This was touched upon by Ken in this video in addition to the film of how ads try to make purchases seem necessary and consumers feel dissatisfied with what they have bought and think the solution is to buy more / something new. Overall, our entire society needs a shift. We need those in power politically to make changes for the manipulators in power economically to change. I agree, and hope, that companies like Reformation are our future and even become an affordable, attainable norm in life.

 I feel the same way. I also qualify for free lunch and fee waivers for tests but I still find myself buying things I can't afford without even thinking about it. It's so crazy to me that I've had this mindset almost all my life and never even questioned it. I like how you gave an example about eating healthy, and how the best option is the hardest to find and the most expensive. I learned in my environmental science class that the best way to make people to something is to make the best option the easiest option.

As much as I appreciate Ken educating us about major problems such as fast fashion, some parts of "The True Cost" were just really hard to watch. Almost 1,000 garment workers died at the Rana Plaza building collapse(The True Cost). An enormous amount of emotion was shown at the Cambodian protests. 250,000 Indian farmers commit suicide a year, 1 farmer a minute(The True Cost). Up to 60 kids in one village have mental illnesses from the harmful farming chemicals.(The True Cost). 50 million liters of waste water/chemicals get dumped into local farming and drinking water(The True Cost). Why are we making countries go through this pain? So each one of us can go ahead and throw away 82 pounds of it each year? No one is even taking responsibility for this. Apparently it helps give jobs to other countries that they wouldn't otherwise have, but we should go further and give the workers a wage they can actually live off of. As much as companies think it's not their fault and that they are helping other countries, the reality is that we are only making their lives worse. We say that we want wealth to be spread world wide and for other countries to develop just as much as we have, but we are hindering their ability by incentivizing countries to ignore safety and well-being in order to get a company to use their manufacturers. I agree with Richard Wolff who believes that America picks and chooses what we are allowed to criticize. Foreign policy and the economy should be criticized just as much as anything else. Companies and the consumer should start realizing the negative affect our lifestyle has on others and take responsibility. I really do not understand in the slightest why the U.S. has continually gotten away with destroying countries/civilizations so we can have our so-called "free country".

One idea a woman points out in “The True Cost” is that fast fashion companies are making a variety of items accessible to consumers in order to create the illusion of wealth, and while doing so, are actually stealing the consumer’s wealth for cheaply made clothing that “can be thrown away without noticing.” What a funny thought: big companies pulling dollars out of our wallet, and we call it “wealth”. But this idea alone does not suffice to answer the question Ken poses in his video, for it begs the question of why we are allowing this to happen. The incident he describes with the makeup commercial targeting 6-year-old girls seems like a good answer to me. And the entirety of Instagram culture and the weird profession of “promotion” that is has generated. People are obsessed with standing out as a way of fitting in now, and want to be the best or have the best of whatever they can. With companies making this mainstream “best” so accessible, it is impossible to resist the urge to purchase it. People don’t really get to choose whether their electronics can watch and hear their every move, and as a result advertisements are excessively manipulative and targeting. From these ideas, I think it is impossible to put the consumer at fault. 
 <br><br>

Additionally, it seems very evident, from all of the material we have covered which discusses the corruption of companies and the damage their doing, that these corporations are truly only concerned about their profit. A consumer may be put directly at fault for trading money for product, but the worldwide sacrifices made by companies to produce these goods points blame in their direction for the economic system working the way it does. When the film addresses the topic of agriculture, it is nauseating to learn of the farmer suicides. The statistic is relayed along with the fun fact that the company that sells the expensive seeds (which require pesticide), also sells the expensive pesticide, and also sells the expensive medicines to cure the illnesses created by these pesticides; the company never loses. Then it is no wonder these farmers want some escape from this totalitarian corporate rule. Perhaps a revolution can occur, as we learn about in history with dictators and monarchs, of producers and consumers who want to escape this economic prison of big business reliance. It would be a challenging feat, but as with all of the issues facing the climate crisis, no big change can really be accomplished without an almost unanimous effort. Companies will not stop making these clothes, or cars, or drilling for oil, until producers stop taking the bait of the money that is offered (often miniscule in comparison to the overall profit), and until consumers will stop falling for that illusion of wealth.

I found that quote that you mentioned that having more stuff makes people feel more wealthy very interesting as well. I also thought this connected to the point that we are getting products at the blood of the workers. These workers in other countries are suffering because we want cheap items. But these huge companies are able to sell us these products throught their marketing skills. I agree that because we are surrounded by our phones, they hear us and are able to market to each person very easily. I constantly see different ads for things I was mentioning ot my friends and it intrigues me to buy it. It is really hard to reduce consumption when everyone around us is telling us to keep buying more and more. 
  <br><br>
I find it very heartbreaking that all these companies care about is making maximum profits. The fact that we continue to purchase anything cheap even though it came at the sacrifice of these really poor people. Along with this people could be dying like the building falling apart because these huge companies want to increase their profits. I agree that the number of farmer suisides was horrible as well. It said the number of suisides is equivilent to one every 30 munutes. I agree that a change needs to be made. Being the producers we do have control and power. We can choose what to buy or what not to buy. Therefore I agree that we need to change our habits in order to help the workers who are hurt by this production.

The film "The True Cost" was a very eye opening experience for myself and I'm sure others. This was an interesting choice by Ken this week, as, again, the climate crisis is not the complete main point. I think this made the film that much more successful, though, for students of this class. Not only do we know that fast fashion is bad for the environment, we now have an in depth look at the workers behind the industry. Watching this, I felt myself thinking about the now-bankrupt company, American Apparel. I'm not sure if everyone knows about this company, but it was basically just cool clothes that everyone at my middle school was obsessed with. At the time, I clearly liked it, too. I was always left upset, though, because the clothes were more expensive than most of the clothes I was buying at the time, and my little middle school self couldn't quite swing it all the time. It wasn't until later that I realized they had a higher price for a reason; all of their clothes were manufactured in the U. S. in a factory with good conditions and minimum wage pay. And so this is why their clothes were a little more, because they were going about it the right way. When I first learned this fact, I had no idea still how rare that was. A few years later, they were out of business. This is what happens to the people who try to do it right, which can only lead big brands like H&M to keep their prices low. As an American consumer, we have to think about what humanity we're hurting by saving $10 on a shirt. Not only that, but what environmental effect we have by consuming all of the time. This movie was definitely hard to watch in some parts, but it was well worth it. One thing I didn't know was how little of clothes we're donating are actually getting sold. Donating clothes was always the conscious decision when getting rid of clothes to buy new ones, but it's not really as good as I thought. This problem is so much bigger than one thing. It's not just holding big companies accountable, or buying from more sustainable brands, or raising wages in factories in Bangladesh, although those are all steps in the right direction. It's the consumer culture of America that needs to be deconstructed. We've spent a few weeks now talking about the negative impact of the consumerism we face in our country, and it seems to just be getting worse. It's not just the environment, though that should be our main focus right now, but it's the mental wellbeing of the entire country that is at stake. The atmosphere we're in now is good for nobody. I believe that some of our issue as Americans is the same issue some people have with believing climate change. It's invisible. We're not seeing the direct impact immediately. We're not seeing the factories in Bangladesh or China or Cambodia. They need to be on the news, on social media, broadcasted so people can't shop without a guilty conscious, and then maybe that'll be a step in the right direction.

<p>
First, I'd like to address the question you posed concerning whether the industry or the consumer was at fault. I think that the largest of corporations, the one's we're primarily referring to in this discussion about ethical and environmental problems, are at fault for the rampant consumerism. Consumers, people, at large first consider the appeal of a product; seldom do they take a moment to consider where it's constituent parts came from. Many are fixed in the present desire for the item. The corporations are the ones in a position to recognize their naive interests and are the ones responsible for not indulging them at the expense of our environment and developing nations. If the means of production were advertised in tandem with the traditional ads, most if not all consumers would reconsider their superficial wants and desires and accept that these things do not simply come at low cost. The unnatural profit and unhealthy size of the largest corporations is due to their willingness to exploit the ecosystem.
  <br><br>

I'd also like to address a fundamental misunderstanding of some of the people that argue that our factories and external influence gives them opportunity and are the way to becoming a developing nation. No, we infect them with our ideas of success. The better part of people being exploited are in these harsh conditions because of what we have done all these years. Our infection is exactly why they are now dependent as they are on our shitty jobs. Before this, their civilization survived happily for millenia without our plague. The nerve of these businessmen to define objective success and happiness when many were happiest before we threatened and destroyed their way of life.
  <br><br>

Unfortunately, other industries are and already have fallen suite to the exploitation of third world companies for their manual labor. The tech industry is one good example and, while I don't have other specific examples (not that I should even need to for 1 is more than enough), there are certainly others too.
  <br><br>

The documentary itself provided a detailed insight into the details of the fashion industry and the unethical practices that they partake in. One of the most shocking things in the documentary was hearing about indebted farmers drinking pesticide after their land was legally robbed from them. Generations of families that had lived and cultivated their land successfully without the presence of Monsanto and similar companies all sacrificed with little to no remorse as they end their family's legacy just to expand the monopoly on injustice.

Watching The Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj’s “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” made me question the intentions of the fast fashion industry. They are damaging our precious earth while also lying to the general public by claiming to take environmentally-friendly precautions.

  <br><br>

“I mean, they’re only clothes.” This is what went through my head before I watched the film, which is what I would imagine to be the reaction of many other audience members besides myself. It was shocking to discover the amount of water used during the process of creating a single sweatshirt- enough water to sustain a single individual for a year! I feel as though the reason why we are still purchasing from fast-fashion brands is that we are not nearly informed enough about the amount of harm that this industry is actually doing to our planet. I hope that there will be more opportunities for the general public to learn about the fashion/fast-fashion industry in the future.

"The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" made me very untrusting of all large corporations, like fast fashion industries. I agree that one of the largest issues brought about in this episode was that these industries are claiming that they are environmentally-friendly. Not only is this deceitful and detrimental to the planet, but it also perfectly demonstrates the way these large corporations prey on the consumer. With a new environmental movement gaining speed, it is popular and trendy to be more "sustainable." Like Hasan Minhaj brought up, these industries saw that people were thrifting more and decided to keep up, they also needed to take a sustainable approach. Rather than make actual change to protect the earth and the consumer, the only changes that were made were to protect big business' wallets. Ambiguous wording and visuals are used in order for the consumer to feel like they're shopping responsibly, when in reality, no real action is being taken to resolve the disastrous impact that fast fashion has on the planet. With this "greenwashing," the company makes money, the consumer's conscience is eased, and the planet is destroyed. I think one of the most important things we can do to help lessen the impact of fast-fashion would be to not only inform the consumer of its dangers, but also of its deceit so that real action can be taken to make their conscience at ease.

The film “The True Cost” put a lot of things into perspective. This film really clarified everything I have ever heard about in the fashion industry. To say the least, I grew up shopping because, in a way, it was a way for me to bond with my mom. However, as I got older and matured a bit more, I realized how I was feeding the capitalistic system. I figured that the clothes that were being sold for a low price had to come at a cost. Little did I know that these costs are extremely detrimental to people who produce these things just so that we could wear and prove to people that we are somebody in society. Watching what happened in Rana Plaza was heartbreaking. These people informed owners before hand, yet nothing was being done to ensure their safety. Their lives were being risked to provide for their families. What angered me was how Kate Ball Young and Benjamin Powell were trying to justify why sweatshops were good for the economy of developing countries. And why we shouldn’t feel bad because they chose to pursue work in the garment industry. What I also don’t understand is why companies who rack up billions of dollars a year by selling clothes made from cheap labor don’t invest it into better working conditions for developing countries. Why aren’t we holding the fashion industry accountable for their inhumane treatment towards workers and the environment? Learning that the fashion industry is the 2nd most polluting industry on Earth was really eye-opening.

It was frustrating to see how chromium from leather factories was being dumped into Kanpur, a river in which 800 million lives rely on. Like how careless can we be at this point?

Last week, I had mentally made it a goal to donate most of the clothes in my closet back home because if they’re not here in sb with me, what’s the point in having them collect dust back home? The fact that only 10% of the clothes we donate are sold is mind boggling. The fact that donating should be a good thing, but in reality, it’s creating more waste and landfill.

To your short point on donations, I also found that fact to stick out to me the most from the film The True Cost. Since childhood, I have donated a lot of clothing to my local Goodwill that I either grew out of or just didn’t wear anymore. It was a mental game: the name of the Nonprofit is “Goodwill” automatically making the donator think they’re doing a good” thing. Although the film didn’t name-drop any corporations or organizations that take clothing donations, it made me think about all of garbage bags filled with clothes I have donated in my life, and only 10% of them end up in thrift stores?? The act of donating makes us feel good about our consumerism and in a way, makes us want to consume more. People will clear out their closets and donate bags filled with clothing just so they can make room to buy more clothes. However, these people are under the impression that the donated clothes are going to a good cause, not just adding to landfills and global waste. After watching the film, I know this idea isn’t correct.
   <br><br>

Before, I tried to make it a point to give some of my “nicer” clothes I outgrew to a relative or friend that could use it. Now, knowing that my clothes could end up in a landfill anyway, I would much rather try to lend or give my clothes to friends and family than contribute to waste suffocating our planet.


<br><hr>
I agree with you because before this film, I looked at fast fashion through a basic lens of factory work and cheap prices. But with this documentary, I was shocked to see and realize how much more it is in terms of violence and danger. My general reaction was both emotional and intellectual because of the families this industry affects. Emotionally, the documentary shows how brutal chemicals and conditions hurt those in third world countries every day. Intellectually, it made me rethink how textile waste is a problem. The newest piece of information that I learned from the film was how ineffective donating clothes can actually be. Even though it is seen as a solution to saving clothing waste, it still piles itself up only in third world countries instead. The film did change my views on fast fashion because of the mistreatment that people face to make the clothing we wear in America today. After watching the film and seeing the harsh reality, I cannot feel optimistic about the future of the industry. It seems that we are so deep in the industry for positive change to be made. Although I disagree with the conditions and unacceptable wages in the industry, I do not see it changing for the better.

Companies are responsible for consumerism, not consumers! The fast fashion industry, as seen in “The True Cost,” is unacceptable and corrupt in so many ways. In my last comment, I note that I have unfortunately fallen into Forever 21’s consumer trap. This video has completely changed that. I knew that working conditions were bad, but I didn’t know that they were as bad as they actually are. I feel so ignorant and stupid for not having realized before that I was contributing to the continuing need for sweat shops. It is unjust. We are not just talking about success of companies, we are “talking about essential human rights,” as the documentary states. 
   <br><br>

This type of consumerism is not limited to the fashion industry. In fact, I have a hard time thinking of any industry that isn’t always promoting their new and improved product. The entire American marketplace has become a breeding ground for companies and corporations to take advantage of consumers. This, in turn, takes a great toll on our planet. 
   <br><br>

I believe that this has been allowed to occur because when people invision a product, they often don’t factor in the supplier and their treatment. First and foremost, they just want their product. We don’t factor in how many gallons of chemicals we pour into rivers surrounding workplaces, which in turn contaminates food and drink. We don’t factor in the ever increasing number of birth defects caused from this chemical contamination. In one village in Punjab, India, there were 60 kids with mental disabilities. This is due to the overuse of pesticides. 
   <br><br>

This is a difficult fact to process because our economy stems from materialism and consumerism. We will have to completely change our ways of life if we are to stop exploiting our neighbors. It is imperative that we change our way of life, and not let the companies control us. There needs to be systemic change in the way that companies promote and rely on consumerism.

After watching " The ugly truth of fast fashion",  I was informed that how bad the fast fashion industry could do to our. environment. Consumers are to blamed because they bought a lot of these to try to make them make nicer, with a cheap. price to look similar to those products whose price is 10 times more expensive than fast fashion stores. However, consumers do not know about the process to make these outfits. In the video, after Hasan told them the. process. of making those outfits, they refused to. buy those fast fashion products. It is normal, and I believe that these are the things we can not avoid using. However, just as what Hasan said, we just need to wear them a little bit longer. To me, I also thought about to buy a second-handcar instead of a new one. We just need to do things we can accept to make our environment better.

After watching the film "The True Cost," I never thought the fashion industry took such a toll on human life and the climate. Seeing all the adults and even kids, be affected by the pesticides had me at a lost of words. The diseases that were portrayed included cancer and mental retardation. Seeing the labor that they went through is horrifying and makes me want to rethink when buying from these huge retail companies. The excess clothes that the company doesn't sell are often dumped into a landfill, taking up unnecessary space and polluting, just to maintain their value in clothes. This film made me realize the truth about the fashion industry and made me realize horrors the come when buying clothes.

I totally agree! After watching this film, I emptied my online shopping cart for h&m. I did not realize what went behind the scenes to make the clothing cheap. The film showed me the brutal working conditions of the sweatshops where the clothes I buy are made, and exposed me to how we Americans take advantage of third world countries and disregard their human rights. There are way better, safer ways to manufacture clothing, however we ignore them in favor of the cheapest, and most dangerous way. From this movie, I realized how lucky I am to live in the United States, but I also feel bad that there are people in third world countries working below minimum wage in unsafe conditions to power the consumerist market of the United States. I don't consider myself a shopaholic, but I do sometimes listen to my impulses of buying something completely random that I do not need. I will try to be more mindful and only start buying things I need, rather than feeding into the sweatshop culture.


<br><hr>

I agree with you. When looking at our belongings we don't stop and think about what went into making them. This film made me realize that most of our clothes are made with the blood and tears of workers. These people are treated like animals and are forced to work in inhumane conditions. Their companies only care about profit and will do anything to make more money. I realized how privileged we are in America - we buy without a thought to the millions who suffer making our belongings. If only more people could see what these workers go through, maybe things would change. Would we be willing to pay more for clothes if the workers who made them were paid an honest, living wage? This film made me think more about the clothes I buy. I now feel like it's better to pay more for a better quality piece of clothing than to buy cheaper clothes that will have a shorter lifetime. This will also reduce the amount of waste since less clothes will have to be bought.
   <br><br>

Seeing people suffer from the injustices of the fashion industry made me angry. It's a ruthless industry that treats people as expendable. We have to hold these companies accountable for the crimes they've committed to these people. They can't keep ignoring labor laws and they have to treat their workers with respect. Perhaps we can start boycotting these companies and only buy clothes from companies who treat workers fairly. While it might cost more money, it is worth it if it allows workers to be paid a fair wage and be treated with dignity.
<br><hr>
I relate to your statement since I too have not really thought of fashion as a contributor to climate change until taking this class. This film honestly terrified me when seeing the damage it does to people’s lives and homes. I was watching this before one of my production meetings and just mentioning a few of the things the film touched on to one of the other production members sent them into a deep sadness due to not knowing what is happening. I think this movie does a great job of expressing the worst parts of the fashion industry that are often hidden from us consumers. For example, the Rana Plaza incident was something I have never heard of before and I am mad about that. This incident was a terrible thing that ruined so many lives, yet these standards are still used to produce cheap clothes mostly for the US. I do not want my clothes in exchange for the abuse and spilling of blood of other people. 
   <br><br>
The worst part of all of this was hearing news outlets and other people say that this situation is really the best thing that these textile workers have. Yes, in our current state this job does not seem that bad in comparison to other jobs. However, we could easily be making this industry much safer and better for the workers. They are losing limbs due to foundational issues in the buildings, their children are being born with disabilities from all the fumes and chemicals produced, and they are living off barely three dollars a day. No one should live like this. These fashion companies could easily be creating better workspaces and pay for these people but they are not. The greed of this money is disgusting and wrong on so many levels. However, even if we boycott the fashion industry, it does not guarantee a better life for these textile workers. The fate of the workers’ lives at are the hands of the most greedy people and this is not fair.
<br><hr>
While I was aware of the fact that clothes manufacturing jobs are outsourced to other countries to lower production costs, I also never stopped to think about how Fast Fashion contributes to the devaluation of human rights and how industries that promote Fast Fashion are literally killing people simply because American businesses will prioritize maximizing profits at all costs. I too was at a loss for words seeing so many lives negatively affected for something out of their control. One cannot help but be heartbroken and infuriated by the fact that cancer and mental retardation among CHILDREN is ultimately a result of America's unwillingness to shift away from consumer capitalism and a constant desire to consume more than we need. I'm not one to purchase and discard clothes without a second thought, but this film also made me realize that we need to be more conscious of how our consumer behavior and decisions affect the world.

One thing I really liked about “The Ugly Cost of Fast Fashion” was how it was short and entertaining, yet informative. Right off the bat we’re hit with the fun fact that Americans are expected to spend $1.1 trillion on Black Friday, and all I can think of is, how can we possibly need an additional $1.1 trillion worth of stuff?? In the US we live in a society where consumerism is a big part of our culture, and we don’t consider the harm we cause to other people, the planet, and even ourselves. Clothes are seen as disposable because of how incredibly cheap they have become, which in turn makes clothing factory workers’ already miserable wages, even lower. What angers me the most is that garment factory workers, people who just want to make a living, are hurt the most. The working conditions are inhumane and enough to stop me from supporting a sick industry. I think if people were forced to see the harm the fashion industry causes, they might reconsider their choices. 
   <br><br>

While as consumers we do play an important role in supply and demand of goods, I completely agree with Thoreau’s belief that corporations are to blame for this overconsumption that has been deeply rooted into our culture. The only ones truly benefiting from out overconsumption are companies and corporations selling clothes. Amancio Ortega, founder of Zara, is worth $70 billion, the seventh richest person in the world. Literally FILTHY rich, it’s truly disgusting. His wealth, as well as a few other individuals’, is built on the pain, suffering, and death of people and the planet. It's frustrating to see that fast fashion brands have the audacity to advertise their clothes as “sustainable” and “green” and because there’s no legal definition for those words, their claims mean nothing, yet they manage to sell the idea of “ethical” clothes. Even if people try to make more environmentally sound choices, big corporations and individuals with power will maneuver their way through any obstacle in order to keep profiting. Yes, we all contribute co2 emissions due to our consumption, but why are only a select number of individuals profiting from it? Of course that’s not to say we’re all free of guilt, but necessary to open our eyes to how much we are influenced by companies whose one goal is to create consumers. 
   <br><br>

A great way to expose people to the urgency of climate change is through short films like this one. I doubt there’s anyone who doesn’t enjoy comedy, making it an effective method to captivate and maintain an audience. Using humor to ease into a certain topic will more likely spark interest to do further research. I think it can also be easier for people to accept our faults with humor, rather than being blamed for “buying clothes.”

I also really enjoyed "The Ugly Cost of Fast Fashion". I am guilty of picking drama television shows to typically entertain me but was very positively surprised at the well done film. Like you, the Black Friday statistics were quite shocking. Another thing that made me really lose it was the clips that were shown of the Black Friday madness. Swarms of people were rushing through crammed store entrances and for what? It seems to me that shopping and consuming in America has become more of a disease than a necessity.

In the film, “ The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion,” I learned how 68 is the average amount of clothes purchased per person per year. It is crazy how in order to feel edgy or valuable , we need to depend on buying clothes to make sure that we are trendy and fitting into the ideal image. Zara is one of the most popular fast fashion detailers and how it is very well known since it constantly tries to break the new trend and influence new shoppers to get the new item. Fast Fashion accommodates the price for the customers being able to purchase the item since it is way cheaper than the actual brand for that item. This persuades the crowd and audience that it is a perfect bargain which boosts the clothing industries and uses social media as advertisement to make them seem more well known and attractive. Dynamic assortment is also a big factor in the video and the main idea is that there is clothing constantly being sold everyday.This pumps up the product to  make sure that it is actually being sold. Because of the high demand in production, this causes our planet to be in a worse state than it originally is due to the excessive gas in the area. The video demonstrates how there are constantly products that are being shipped, so there is a high demand in transportation which causes a lot of gas into the atmosphere. Many clothing companies like Hollister are trying to be more fast fashion, so that they can be more successful industries and have a lot of advertisements to help them to do that as well.It is interesting how  much water is being consumed into these products which are 10,330.  It is sad because we can be using this water for more useful ways to save the planet than our selfish desires. This is very disappointing how we focus more on the clothes that we want to look trendy than using this materials to help boost the economy and our community.

“The True Cost” demonstrates how fast fashion can affect our health, environment, and economy. I agree with Thoreau that the industry is more at fault. In the film, a woman discussed how the only one making money is the clothing company’s owner. Fast fashion industries are truly the instigators of the situation. The poorly treated workers barely get paid, and these companies charge consumers a cheap production for a more expensive cost. Although I agree with Thoreau, as consumers, we also need to take social responsibility and be more cautious of the source we buy from. Fashion companies will use the excuse that they won’t have better jobs, but by flexing our consumer power, we can sway companies into giving them a better norm of their labor-intensive jobs.
    <br><br>
After watching the film, I was shocked at how the fast fashion industry affects a lot of things from the ground up. I didn’t know there could be such a  thing like monopoly on seeds. I was surprised to see how much fashion can affect agriculture. Earlier, my roommate heard the documentary playing, and she expressed her astonishment because she hasn’t really heard about the dramaticness of this issue. Then, I bring up the movement of refusing to consume goods from sweatshops. However, she’s right though. Even though we are sort of aware that sweatshops are bad, we don’t really understand the extent of how bad. I didn’t think it would be affecting-an-entire-small-population bad. In addition to fast fashion, I believe we are transitioning to things like fast consumer products.

I too was shocked at the lengths fashion companies go to in order to maximize their profits, illustrated by “The True Cost”. The conditions and wages these workers are subjected to because of the direness of their circumstances, it's all to clear the external costs of the cheap clothing we buy here are the burden of the workers manufacturing them. I also found the strategies these companies use to encourage our continuous and limitless consumption of their products quite insidious. However, while they foster these attitudes for consumption, ultimately it is us, the consumers, who are to blame. Personally, I feel foolish for not considering the negative externalities of my own purchases, and who really bore the costs of my consumption
    <br><br>


Like most everything we’ve discussed so far, reversing these behaviors is a great task, and like most other things it’s made even harder by the role of social media. Like Ken pointed out, it doesn’t help that fashion and other forms of consumption are so consistently and constantly reinforced as American ideals. 

    <br><br>

Until recently I’ve been of the find, and I think I’ve said this a few times that, “all I want in life is for the clothes on my hangers not to touch each other.” This is how I wanted to measure my success. But it wasn’t until recently that I reevaluated this. Perhaps my goal shouldn’t be to have a large closet, but instead I should aspire to have a small wardrobe.

I agree that the corporations in charge of the fashion industry literally dominate the entire supply chain. They literally make it seem like the goods they provide are quality items, when in fact they are just crap. I think it's so crazy how much is hidden from the consumer by industries such as fast fashion. I think the worst part is that even if people are trying to consume consciously, it is extremely hard to do because of how items are marketed and how supply chains are hidden from plain sight. Especially when companies make wrongful claims about their goods being "green", "sustainable" or "ethical" because these words have become trendy. This is just straight-up greenwashing because there is no way a sweatshop using children and extreme hours is ethical. This makes an environmental issue and social justice one as well. 

    <br><br>

While I'm glad consumers are switching to more conscious goods and practices, but that still doesn't excuse buying extreme amounts of clothes when the ones we have in our closet will do just fine until they fall apart. However, stopping the consumption of these clothes decreases the demand for goods, which causes women to lose their jobs, which is their stable source of income. What are we to do to the women once we end the industry that employs them?

If each person wore their clothes longer or bought their clothing items secondhand, then that would be equivalent to taking half a million cars off the road...that's crazy if you think about it.

I watched "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" because I watched "The True Cost" last quarter in English 22, and Hasan brought up so many unique points and facts that I have never heard of, and how fast fashion is destroying our planet day after day. 
    <br><br>
It's so unfortunate that in the 1980s, the average American bought 12 new pieces of clothing every year (which is still kind of a lot). This number has skyrocketed in our society today, with the average American buying up to 68 clothing items per year, and a dominant force of fast fashion has been the reason for this large increase. These trendy clothes, according to Hasan, are cheap and disposable, and he compares these fast fashion clothing to toilet paper; this entire model has arguably changed the entire world of fashion. In another report, it was shown that women buy an average of 64 new pieces of clothing a year, and most of these are worn three times or less. 
    <br><br>
After discussing about these numbers, Hasan then shifted to how companies such as Zara and Fashion Nova completely changed the fashion game by combining two techniques: quick response manufacturing and dynamic assortment. Quick response manufacturing is when companies, such as Zara, sell knockoffs of expensive releases and then utilized streamline distribution. These knockoff methods are technically not illegal because they are not considered counterfeit, so the knockoff clothing items are mass produced daily and cause harm to our planet. 
    <br><br>
After watching this video, I felt extremely discouraged; it's sad that the clothing industry, mass production, and the fast fashion culture is contributing more to the growth of the climate crisis than flight travel. The average American throws away 80 pounds of clothing each year, and these clothes are then dumped in countries such as Kenya and Africa. Although the video mentioned how there are methods in which Americans can lower their carbon footprint with clothing, it seems like there are no signs of the clothing industry slowing down.

I believe that our consumerism problem should be blamed both on consumers and companies. Without the materialistic values instilled in consumers, companies would not be producing the amount of stuff that they produce today because they would have less business. However, companies are largely responsible for drilling these materialistic values into the consumers. Companies and corporations spend loads of money on advertising, all with the purpose of convincing people that the way to solve the problems in your life is through consumption. This drives consumerism to unhealthy levels.

    <br><br>

Watching “The True Cost” hit a little different. You always hear about the detrimental effects of fast fashion, but visually seeing these effects play out in third world countries, really made me stop and think. People are losing their lives because of consumerism here in America. In Bangladesh’s Rana Plaza Disaster, over 1000 people were killed because factory management failed an order to evacuate. This stemmed from the desperation of keeping the American company that they worked for. In Cambodia, riots broke out on the streets due to protests of higher wages. These low wages also stemmed from the outsourcing done by American companies. Consumers in America drive the fast fashion industry, which in turn results in sweatshops in third world countries. People die everyday because of our materialistic values, and the climate is dying as well. We need to change the system that we have in America because the consequences most definitely outweigh the benefits.

I feel like I have known for a while how most things we own have a tag on them that say "Made in China" or "Made in Bangladesh" but I never heard the truly dark stories of the factory workers and the horrible conditions they go through for just a 3 dollar a day income. Large corporations such as H & M are so extremely hypocritical to me because they act like they want to protect workers in other countries that produce the clothes they can sell for such a low price, but in reality these corporations ONLY care about their own profit and continuing the vicious cycle of capitalism. The one story that truly devastated me was the horrific tragedy of Rana Plaza where over 1000 workers died. It particularly saddened me because most of these garment workers are women and children who cannot voice their opinions and stand up for their own rights. They can't tell the owners of their factories and managers about bad working conditions or ask for better wages or they would get beaten up as one woman explained. I don't think we can put the blame on these owners, I think most if not all the blame has to be placed on the large corporations who solely desire free markets and profit over the safety of their workers.
    <br><br>


I think this documentary was very smart in showing the different aspects of the fashion industry. For example, showing the effects on American cotton farmers such as the woman who talked about her own experiences with growing cotton was a good way to illustrate to Americans that this issue hits home as well. She talked about how her own husband died from stage 4 brain cancer at age 50, and many other agricultural workers have also died because of the chemicals in producing cotton. She desires organic cotton to be the main source of cotton because it is better for the environment and for the health of farmers and ordinary Americans alike. 

    <br><br>

Regarding the question about whether the blame is fully on these large corporations or also on us consumers, I truly think that most of the blame has to be put on the large corporations. By making prices so cheap and advertisements in such smart ways, many consumers can't see what really goes into the production of their clothes so they believe that fast fashion is an amazing invention that we are lucky to be part of. It honestly frustrates me so much how workers in other countries can't do anything to save themselves, as they usually have no other alternatives as mentioned in the video. Shima was a remarkable person because she did whatever it took to make sure her daughter has the right educational opportunities so she doesn't have to work as a garment factory worker in her future, even if it meant being separated from her for most of the year.

After watching the documentary film “The True Cost”, I was surprised by the sheer amount of extra costs that are not taken into account when the fast fashion industry produces their products: poor working conditions that pose threats to safety of workers (the collapse of the garment factory in Dhaka as well as increased risk of suicide and developing terminal illness in India) and environmental damage from pollution (chromium 6 contamination in Indian river and poisoned soil by pesticides). It is sad to see, despite the harsh and terrible working conditions, parents in those less economically-developed countries make sacrifices for these jobs while leaving their children elsewhere. At the same time, I also see hope in a fairer treatment to workers after learning about the works of fair trade brands like the People Tree and how they try to bring more awareness of economic injustice globally. To me, I thought this is inevitable as economic growth often comes with stagnated social equality, but what’s worse in this case is the fact that the profits go to corporates instead of people who actually produced the clothes. It was also disappointing to see how government and legal services react to people who want their voices to be heard: the congress reacted passively in the United States and the Cambodian government reacted violently against the backlash of Cambodians supporting labor rights. Since Ken mentioned how Thoreau will blame the industry when it comes to the question of whether consumers or industry takes the responsibility for all these ramifications, I would very likely agree with Thoreau too. Industry should be blamed because they hired advertisers from a long time ago to alter the behaviors of consumers and shift a mentality that longed for durable goods to one that seeks to purchase for social status symbols and psychological fulfillment (according to the reading of this week). Consumers are victims of their plans, but I think it is crucial to educate consumer nowadays to not give in to the “fast-buying” mentality and stop letting big brands to rip off workers.

The point you made about the governments supporting this issue is such a great point. Once again, the problems we are learning about relates back to the government. These workers do know they are being exploited and want to have a voice and fight back but the government prevents this. That Cambodia scene really shocked me that they would go to extents of shooting people on the streets. In order for these workers to fight for better conditions they must all fight against these big businesses together. They mentioned the issue of competition but if everybody agreed to raise their prices, brands like H&M will have no choice but to oblige as their is no "cheaper" option. This shouldn't even be the case to begin with because like you said the big corporations should take more responsibility for what they're doing. We as consumers should do our part in not supporting these companies as their ways are harming for the environment, harming towards our own happiness, and harmful towards the lives of other human beings. We must stop the "fast-buying" mentality you speak of to end this culture that we have become trapped in.


<br><hr>

I have much the same feeling as you when you talk about the fairness of workers in poor conditions. it is sad to see that the government and company in the industry conspire to exploit every benefit from people. This is unacceptable and abandons the rights of people. After watching this video, I have a whole new idea about how the fashion industry is ruling over people and the planet. Every since from now, I would be guilty of my consumerism point of view. As I purchase a new and fancy product from the fast fashion industry, I feel like I am adding one more amount of burden on the poor people in countries like Cambodia and Bangladesh. It doesn't feel good and I now get the idea that consumption is not equal to happiness such that a new page of ideas needs to be promoted. It is also important to keep in mind that the consumers share the same blame as the polluting industries such as fast fashion and it should not be either we or the industry's duty to revolutionalize the definition of the American dream. What I trying to say here is that consumers, industries, and the government should all work together to solve the crisis. In particular, the consumers need to proactively identify the brainwashing and greenwashing from environmental polluting industry and to run away from an obsession with goods; the industries should slow down the growth and stop the misleading information that causes generational problems; and finally, the government has to stand with people and the planet and strive to find the balance between economic growth and environmental protection.

I really appreciated the attempted comedy in the video "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" as it made it an easy yet interesting film to watch. This informational video covered many subjects, however one that stood out to me the most was the water pollution in Indonesia (specifically the Citarum river). In this video clip, it shows a mother speaking about how her children are constantly sick, and how the last time she took her son into the doctor they told her he had signs of liver problems. This broke my heart to see that children's well beings were being directly effected by Zara and H&M (two companies that actively used factories that led to this pollution), two companies that I frequently shop at. It was also absurd to see that the process of creating clothing from trees only uses around 30% of the materials and the rest of it are discarded like waste, and in the case of the Citarum river, the chemical waste discarded into rivers and other bodies of water. This complete indifference of the companies infuriates me as it has become such a major issue yet it is rarely talked about and these companies are never usually exposed in this manner. I think another interesting part of this film was how the speaker called out big name brands for using words that have a loose definition in order to trick consumers into thinking that their brand is actually not harmful to the environment. The fact that consumers fall for their tricks (including myself) is concerning as people should know about these advertising tactics.

A few of my friends who watched this movie in the past told me it truly had an impact on them but I thought there is no way a single movie could change the way someone leads their life in terms of buying clothes, when it’s been something they’ve done their whole life. However, now having watched The True Cost, I take all of that back. That was super intense and unexpected. I knew the premise of the movie, and I’ve known for a while that fast fashion isn’t a good thing, but it was one of those things I just let fly. Watching this movie has completely changed my view on this industry, in a very negative way. By writing this comment, I want to hold myself to no longer spend money on brands that contribute to that horror. From now on, I want to purely shop at thrift stores. By giving money to these brands, we are completely voting with our dollar. I can’t believe it has taken me this long to realize how disgusting and inhumane of an industry this really is, but I’m glad I’m learning about it now, rather than later. 
    <br><br>
It’s mind blowing that America now only contributes to manufacturing 3% of its clothes. Companies outsource to developing countries where wages are so beyond low and where regulations protecting workers’ rights are very minimal, simply to get the cheapest production. As can be seen in the movie, they will stop at nothing and will do anything for the lowest price. Because the companies don’t own the factories, they aren’t held accountable for the workers making their clothes, and are let off the hook when things go wrong, as can be seen through the Rana Plaza incident. Over 1000 people died when an eight story factory building collapsed, even though warnings were given. Because these American and European countries have such a hold on the sweatshops, the owners of these factories will stop at nothing because they need the money, even when lives are at stake. That horrible incident could’ve been prevented, but because the factory owners and workers rely on the money to survive, they didn’t shut down the factory to make repairs. They couldn’t afford to lose business. And this example is only one example. There are definitely so many more cases. And aside from the incidents, either way, the working conditions are horrible and they get paid so little. Families get separated because of how toxic the working environments are. That shouldn’t be. It’s inhumane.

This film, like all others, was eye-opening. I never knew how much I actually contributed to the terrible fast fashion industry until I reflected on my own choices while watching this film. I love fashion, and I do believe it is our “chosen skin” but like the film said the fast fashion industry only looks after big business interest. It’s crazy to see how all the stores I shop at are a part of the fast fashion industry, and how I contribute to the running of sweatshops in other countries. 
    <br><br>

It’s sad to see how other countries rely on making Americans happy to survive, and how they have to make adjustments to their businesses basically at our whim. My favorite stores to shop at are forever 21, zara, h&m, hollister, and urban outfitters because of their prices, and I teared up while watching the dead bodies of textile workers who make my clothing. I know its easy for Americans to think of themselves as heroes (b/c they only think of themselves and think they rule the world) but fueling the fashion industry and justifying the horrendous working conditions in sweatshops by saying “well at least they have a job” is utterly disgusting. Sweatshop workers already have to deal with low wages, dangerous working conditions, and a lack of child labor laws, and the last thing they need is pretencious americans asking for gratitude. 
    <br><br>

It is also a huge problem how much clothing American buy and waste in a year, and how they think the way to solve problems in life “is through consumption.” Personally, I don’t buy too much clothing because I don’t have the money to, but that leads to another problem...I resort to fast fashion. As someone who is always broke, I shop at fast fashions stores because I get the most for my money. For example, I looked up the people tree website because I think they’re doing great work and I wanted to perhaps start purchasing clothes from them, but of course dresses are 100-200 dollars each, even when they are on sale. I know that back in the 60’s there were only 2 seasons and now we have like 52, so the point is to buy less clothing and of higher material, but shopping on websites like people tree is impossible for me. I’m trying to do as much as I can to help the planet (which should be celebrated instead of discouraging people to do more by pointing out their flaws) but I think the only solution is to solely shop at thrift stores. 
    <br><br>

I will try very hard, but honestly it’s going to take a long time for me to stop shopping at fast fashion stores. I’m sorry.

We used to believe that producers produce variety of goods to serve our needs. However, the truth is they are creating new consumers for their products, which means they create a new culture to persuade people that their products are vital part of your life. For example, when thousands of advertisements built a relationship between happiness and success with luxury cars or big house, they create a atmosphere in society that if you don't own these things, you are a loser and will be laughed by everyone else. What's worse, it is hard to notice this trap if one surrounded by all these ads as a child. He or she will consider it as a normal or exist fact. Many young girls purchase large amount makeups under such culture and the same trend happened on other goods as well. These ads stimulate the consuming but make our planet worse. The process of producing goods emits tons of CO2 into the atmosphere and exacerbates the greenhouse gas effect. Human are making the Earth inhabitable when pursuing vanity and satisfying desires. Many even don't realize the terrible and irreversible consequences of massive production. "The true cost" reveals the ugly truth of the producing process, and alarm us to put attention on the damage of environment that caused by "fast fashion" and many other industries.

As remarkable documentaries, both two films tell the prosperity of the clothing industry and behind the prosperity are serious labor issues and the cost of environmental pollution. Through the interview, it introduces the history of fast fashion and how clothing impacts the world. And it gives a lot of data and stories to depict severe issues behind such flourishing. This film has a lot of data and interviews to emphasize the problem. It is easy to understand even though we have no background information. And it can also give more ideas to the people who are concerned about labor issues and environmental problems.
    <br><br>
I was so shocked when I watched these two films. Our choices for buying clothes can significantly impact the world and other people. These may be problems that we don’t care about when we buy clothes. In order to gain a competitive advantage, big companies cut down costs by exploiting labor. They hire cheap workers and build low-cost factories which are in poor condition. In Bangladesh, 85 percent of laborers are women and just earn 3 dollars a day. They don't even care about their workers’ safety. One factory owner states that they just wanted a cheap price and a good profit. When we shop around to find some bargains, it approximately means we exploit those workers at the same time. I feel so sorry for those workers who are suffering from those problems. And I think we may not be able to change the entire clothing industry system, but we can do some small things from our choices. We need to respect the creativity of designers and laborers in every process. Also, we need to treasure every piece of clothing. Moreover, I think maybe we can transmit this idea through comedies or cartoons.

I think The True Cost was a very strong film to show because it forces people to consider what is happening behind the scenes of their fast fashion shopping. By showing personal accounts of awful labor conditions, the film humanizes those who suffer to enable companies like H&M and Topshop to offer ridiculously cheap products. I felt terrible watching Shima struggle against the factory owners to make even a tolerable living. I was especially jarred by the anecdote she shared about attempting to rebel against the factory owners only to be brutally crushed by violent retaliation. Their struggles are obscured and almost never talked about in the media so very feel people know about the horrific conditions people in Bangladesh and India are experiencing. 
    <br><br>
The collapse of Rana Plaza was very hard for me to watch. I cannot believe that many lives were lost for such a silly reason. I was disgusted by the fact that the factory owners ignored employee's concerns regarding the unstable building. If casualties occurred on a scale even half of that in the United States, people would be up at arms. Although because it is out of direct view, people do not care about this issue. 
    <br><br>
I noticed many parallels between this film and Fire in Paradise. 3/4 tragedies in the history of fashion have occurred in the past 4 years which reminded me of the fact that the majority of the world's most destructive wildfires have also happened in the past couple years. I also saw a connection between the big companies' neglect of safety in pursuit of maximum profit. PG&E and the factory owners in Dhaka were both aware of the risk they were imposing by continuing to work in unsafe conditions yet they continued nonetheless. This incredible selfishness is a huge reason for the climate crisis as a whole. People often value their own betterment ahead of the planet's longevity as well as other people's lives. One final thing that I was completely blown away by was that in the last 16 years, there have been more than 250,000 farmer suicides in India(one farmer every 30 minutes). That is actually insane to me. Once again, if this was happening in the U.S. there would be collective outrage and instant attemts at reform but people are unbothered by issues out of their line of sight.




</p><hr>


<p>
When someone mentions climate change, the first issues that pop up in our heads are probably rising sea levels, polar ice caps melting, coal mining, oil rigging, or global temperature rise. It would be unlikely for the fashion and clothing industry to make it to that list. Yet little do we know, the fashion industry is the second most polluting industry after oil. (How did I not know this?)
    <br><br>


The problems with fashion are extensive. Not only did it dishearten me to learn that workers are treated inhumanely, but to hear the heads of these companies claim that “there are a lot of worse things that [sweatshop workers] can be doing” and watching them try to justify low wages, unsafe conditions, and possible factory disasters repulses me. It is so selfish that they put the company’s profit above the lives of their workers. 

    <br><br>

Furthermore, there was one comment in the film that I felt really applied to my life, and that’s donating clothes and items my family doesn’t need or use anymore to charity. Since my family has been doing this since I was really young, I automatically assumed we were doing a good thing, that we were giving a poor kid a new (used) toy to play with or a strapped mother a new (worn) blouse for work. But what shocked me is that only 10% of these donations are actually sold in thrift stores, and the rest goes to developing countries like Haiti where they sit in mounds and in a way, take people’s jobs away (too many clothes from countries like the U.S. —> no need to produce more —> sewing skills going to waste). 

    <br><br>

I think the documentary as a whole really showed me that there are so many problems in the world I don’t know about. But when you lay them all out, a huge portion of them points at climate change, at the health of our planet and our future, and at the actions we each need to take today. I think I speak for many when I say it’s all a little overwhelming to think about, but at the same time, absolutely necessary to stress over.

I know that for me I thought climate change was basically oil and trash, but once we dug deeper into the problems, I was surprised to hear that the clothing industry is the second polluter. I can understand before the video how we waste the materials, but when I saw how poorly sweatshop workers were treated I did not really care as much about the climate change. The one woman telling us about their attempt to unionize was difficult because my dad and I talk about how lucky we are that we actually have that freedom, but those workers were beaten for it. Then the lady from Fox “News” has the audacity to say that it isn't that bad? Like you said, how could they put their profit over the lives of these people? Anyways, back to the climate change- my family and I always donate our clothes, but I can not help to feel guilty for being so ignorant to how I consume products. My mom always made us donate to Goodwill, but now I know that there are so many different ways to dispose of our clothing. Hopefully if as a country we cut back on our consumer habits it will cause a positive chain of events.

This film could also be connected to our previous film on minimalism. Although life in Bangladesh and the Indian cities is much harsher, they too must give up loved ones in order to make any sort of living. It makes me upset that there is such a difference in the classes no matter where you look and another reason I think Switzerland has got the point on how to make life work. People die of work related accidents all the time and that is not how the clothing industry should work, labor should not be that intense and money should not be that powerful. The workers are treated like slaves and when they do finally go home all the pollution from their work contaminates their drinking water. There needs to be change immediately.

I would like to focus on the part of the comment regarding how companies justify subjecting workers to awful conditions for profit. Although I'd love to say that people at People Tree are going to help transform fashion, I am highly skeptical. As the documentary pointed out, this issue runs much much deeper than fashion. The fashion industries massive harms are purely a symptom of a broken economic system. As my role model Richard Wolff pointed out, when you have an economic system that rewards exploitation, there is no way to "reform your way out" of the situation. I genuinely believe that a massive economic transition away from unfettered capitalism needs to occur. I also found it hilarious (and disgusting) to watch the fox news host try to justify sweatshops. It truly shows the priorities of this backward country. To be completely honest it's unbelievable that we live in a country where you can justify allowing THOUSANDS to die just so people can have cheaper clothes they barely wear. Every video, paper, and lecture that I see makes me more and more convinced that the US is the source of all evil in this world. Yet people still seem patriotic about our capitalist system, as if its a point of pride that we exploit poor people in other countries. People wonder why the amazon is being destroyed and Indonesia's rainforests are being flattened, well there is a one-word answer, P R O F I T. For example, the company mentioned during the documentary, Monsanto, has taken part in the destruction of nearly 50% (probably closer to 75% now) of Indonesia's rainforest for palm oil. Is palm oil necessary? Is it more important than the chimpanzees that are going extinct? No self-respecting human being can genuinely tell me that girl scout cookies and cosmetics are worth destroying one of the largest ecosystems in the world. In the US, whether its the fashion industry or agricultural industry, it doesn't matter, the environment and respecting human life is always secondary to profit. That is what needs to be changed. Nothing else will be sufficient. That doesn't mean we shouldn't make lifestyle changes or participate in local elections, but I personally cannot see a world in which respect the environment and unregulated capitalism can exist in one world.

Great points all around! I totally agree that there are so many disputes within the world of the climate crisis that do not get fully explained. In regards to your concerns about thrift stores and their percentages of sold items, I used to work at Destined for Grace Thrift Store in Goleta (great shop by the way, everyone should check it out), and while we did not put everything we received out on the floor, we had a really cool system I wanted to share with the class. Everything that was too damaged to be sold or unsellable for any reason was given to a company who would pick up bags of clothes from us weekly that recycle the cloth into stuffing for pillows/other goods. Additionally, we had 2-3 other separate businesses/organizations/free lance sellers who would take everything we did not put directly on the showroom floor. While we did have to throw away some items, I am happy to report that that percentage was a fairly small portion of the items we received. I know every thrift store (especially corporate thrift businesses) do not operate this way, but it was relieving to have first hand experience that there are some great local businesses in our area who really have forward outlooks on how to maximize benefits for the most amount of people while trying to keep waste to minimum.

Watching The True Cost paired with our readings last week about minimalism shed light on just how dangerous our consumer culture is. As you said, I too barely considered the fashion industry as a cause of climate change, yet they are ranked second behind the oil industry. The first and most important thing that angers me about the fashion industry is the unethical ways they source their clothing. I already knew about the terrible factory working conditions in places like China and Bangladesh. However, each time I revisit the topic it only makes me angrier, and there never seems to be any real progress. Corporations only change their unethical ways when there's so much public backlash that they are forced to. One thing that struck me is that the movie showed us the perspective of factory owners. It talks about how US clothing brands pressure owners to impose terrible conditions on their works because otherwise, they'd have no business. Brands can simply move around to the cheapest factories. This is an inherent problem with unregulated capitalism. The top 1% can go rampant and grow their wealth to insane amounts at the expense of human life. Brands in the fashion industry promote consumerism, and then overwork workers to match the desire for their clothing. Then, as you said, they have the audacity to make comments about how life could be worse for their workers. It's crazy, we need to move away from this terrible throwaway culture and towards minimalism. We need to educate people on the actions of the fashion industry. This kinda stuff should be taught in middle school, the fact that I’m just learning about most of this now terrifies me because I know there are so many others who don’t have the opportunity to receive this same education.
<br><Hr>
You are 100% right. I believe that lack of education is the main issue regarding the perpetuation of climate change. We are only halfway through the quarter yet I have already learned more about climate change in the past five weeks than In the past ten years of my life. If this information could be passed down throughout the world, there would be major changes everywhere and in every facet of our lives.
    <br><br>

I love how this film encompasses every facet of the fashion and clothing industry. As you mentioned, only 10% of donated clothes is sold in thrift stores. This statistic is shocking not because of the quantitative value it represents but because donated clothes is not something that we think about often. I, like many other people, have donated a significant portion of my clothes and toys to various nonprofit organizations yet I had never even considered for a second that my clothes would instead be shipped away to gigantic clothing piles in various third world countries and given away. Additionally, I love how this film considers the perspective of a minimum wage worker in a less developed country life Bangladesh. American minimum-wage workers live significantly different lives than Bangladeshi workers do and it was refreshing yet terrifying to learn about their struggles.a
<br><Hr>
I think you make an extremely important observation that the connection between environmental damage and the fashion industry doesn’t readily come to mind. Many people fail to take into account the negative effect that their habit of consumption can potentially have on the environment. Like you said, hearing the statistic that only 10% of donated goods are actually resold at thrift stores was shocking to me, and it definitely made me rethink my attitude toward buying things that I don’t really need. My family has always made it a habit to clean out our closets biannually and then donate trash bags full of no longer worn or no longer fitting clothes to Goodwill. This doesn’t mean that we would then go out shopping to replace those items, but I can say that it provided us with a certain feeling of comfort for the next time we wanted to buy a shirt we didn’t need. Now knowing that donating your clothes doesn’t excuse you from being responsible for the impact that landfills full of clothes are having on the environment, this comfort has surely disappeared. 

    <br><br>

As with the production of anything, clothing stems all the way back to the very cotton it’s made out of. During the film, a point was brought up about how people are so concerned about the produce they’re eating being organic and pesticide-free, but yet very little people take into consideration wearing clothes produced from organically grown cotton. This lack of consideration has enabled companies like Monsanto to develop genetically modified seeds and patent those seeds, leading them to gain a monopoly over the seed industry. With monopolies as such, it makes it very difficult for small or organic farmers to be competitive. Many are left struggling and will be so far in debt that their land will be taken from them. This has caused 250,000 suicides amongst farmers in India in the last 16 years. So not only is the fashion industry ruthless in their treatment of workers, but the cotton industry is also cut-throat in terms of who gets control over which seeds. The underlying connection between these two industries, of course, is consumerism. Consumerism is the very fire that gives these industries life and thus is responsible for the hurt it’s inflicted on workers along the way.

<br><Hr>
I, too, had the same reaction: how was I not aware of the fashion industry’s impact on our environment and on other countries? When I would go out shopping with friends or for other occasions it never went through my mind where it all came from and the effects of what happens to the clothes I give away and not end up wearing. I’d look at the tags of the clothing that I bought to see how to wash it and always see the “made in _____” letters but never truly thought of how and why it was made in a different country other than America. 
    <br><br>

You explained it perfectly: “The problems with fashion are extensive”. They truly are. These innocent people are just simply trying to make a living for their families and our country is using them for their cheap work to make a profit off of us consumers. It’s sickening. The situations that they have to go through and we still try to explain it could be worse for them. The documentary truly opened my eyes to what happens to those who make the clothing and the waste it creates once it’s used and given away. I look forward to learning new things about the causes of climate change to ultimately do the best that I can to ultimately end this.

<br><Hr>
I agree with you! It is hard, at least for me, to realize the terrible impacts of the fast fashion industry on environments while I was going shopping. I am an international student, and every time when I saw the clothes at “H&M” are produced in my home country, my mood is complicated. I was impressed that my home country is such an industry country, but I was sad about the burden caused by the fast fashion industry. Fast fashion outfits are produced with low cost for its damage to the environment. When we felt lucky about how little we paid for a nice shirt, we should also think about how much damage to the environment behind it.

<br><Hr>


 fashion is an important culture in America and yes it is the 2nd most polluting industry. The fashion industry is a very unethical business. We know how fashion industries treat their workers with low paying jobs, harsh environments, and no benefits. However, we still choose to contribute to this by buying clothes every season. 
    <br><br>

The average American buys 64 pieces of clothes every year. This is as a result of fashion advertising that we must dress for four different seasons in a year; that being: Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer. 
    <br><br>

Hence this a reason why we must discontinue to contribute to fast fashion and purchase our clothes in thrift stores. 
    <br><br>

This documentary really opened my eyes. Our consumerist society is addicted to buying new clothes so often that we forget how much these habits can impact people's lives. We must put our value, time and money into other things.
<br><Hr>
I liked that this comment focuses on the fact that there are so many things and industries that are detrimental to the climate that even those of use who are generally well informed do not know about or consider.  I am not sure why this is the case. Is it because the climate crisis has so many causes that we can’t focus on all of them? Is it because things like sea level rising and the problems of oil are easier for people to understand as a problem? Is it because there are so many other problems with the fashion industry that its effect on climate is overshadowed? Or is it because acknowledging the global problems of the fashion industry requires cultural change that the first world doesn;t want to occur? I think it is probably a combination of many of these things. Pointing out the extensive amount of issues with the fashion industry, including its negative impact on climate, proves just how successful their advertising has been to the consumers promoting this industry's success. It is certainly very important to look at the mounds of industries that contribute to our climate crisis and to make positive lifestyle changes at every level of the problem. 
     <br><br>
Another interesting comment that was discussed both in this comment and in Ken’s video is the astonishing statistic that only 10% of donated clothing actually gets reused.  I think this statistics is effective by many things. First, the 52 season per year fashion industry that we now live in promotes things going out of style rapidly, this makes almost everything that is donated or resold be automatically tagged as old or dingy. Another interesting thing that might be affecting this statistics is that this cycle of fast fashion is also promoting manufacturers to make things of poorer quality, because they don’t need to last long anyways. As thrifting becomes more popular I have realized that people aren’t thrifting things that come out of this fast fashion era, but things of superior quality that come before the time of fast fashion.


<br><Hr>
I agree with much of what you said about a broken economic system. The social and environmental injustices in third world countries caused by the American consumerist society is a systemic issue; the way the American economy works needs to fundamentally change in order for outsourced workers to have better working conditions and wages. The businesses and their top executives are responsible for this vicious cycle because they have the most power in influencing the economic system. People in power are so focused on money, and nothing will stop them from making profit because that is what American capitalism has valued for many decades. As individual consumers, we can do our part by choosing not to buy products from fast fashion companies and companies in other industries with unethical work practices. If enough consumers change their values, companies will lose their customers, their source of profit, and lose the power they have in the economy.

     <br><br>

Before watching the True Cost, I was already quite conscious about not shopping at fast fashion retailers and being mindful of what clothes I buy completely new. After watching the True Cost, I plan to avoid buying clothes at fast fashion retailers, and if I do plan on making purchases, to do them mainly second-hand or from brands that create sustainable and ethically made clothing. The documentary also gave me a better understanding of the meaning behind “organic cotton.” The film explained how “As our appetite for fashion grows, the cotton plant itself is being re-engineered to keep up,” and many toxic chemicals and genetic modifications are put in place to continue producing more and more cotton. It is so saddening to see the overuse of our earth and soil, the health effects on farmers all across the world who are forced to use pesticides on their farm, and it has made aware of the importance of supporting organic products.

<br><Hr>
I hated watching this film. Not that it was bad or anything, but it really showed the truth of what America is to the rest of the world. It was overwhelming to watch, I feel even if I do not buy clothes many others will still continue and it makes me feel helpless to know this. It also makes me feel bad because I love clothes and I have more than I need. I now hate the idea of shopping, at some of the places I used to shop at. I saw an Old Navy today and I was about to walk in to check it out, but I told myself it is bad, so I continued walking. Even though I had no plan of buying anything I just felt as if I was doing something wrong by browsing. When I saw the denim on the front posters of old navy it reminded me of the images of the stacked up jeans in Bangladesh and the workers crushed to death. 

     <br><br>

I was also repulsed by the woman who said that there were worst things these "workers" could be doing, they are practically slaves, the working conditions I saw in the film were not at all what you would see in businesses here, at least I hope not. I literally could not believe people actually think like this. What could have happened to them to have these perspectives. It astonishes me.

<br><Hr>
I feel you! I've been encouraged to donate my old clothes and other stuff to charity since I was very young, so I was shocked and disappointed when the film said that a huge portion of our donated clothes would be wasted and even become a cause of pollution. We were trying to do something kind and generous, but it ended up negatively. Just like you said, people rarely relate environmental crises with the fashion industry. Most of us probably have never realized how hazardous those fashion waste could be until taking this class. Not only for our environment but also for the workers who worked in this industry. Their safety and health are not guaranteed while their wage is too low to support their life. This issue has been lasting very long but never got solved.
<br><Hr>
I agree when people think of the climate crisis they do think of geographical terms such as the big ice caps melting and not about how societies obssession with fast fashion  is one of factors. I think people are aware that large amounts of trash are thrown out everday which affects our planet, but do not really care for it as it doesn’t directly affect their daily lives.What I don’t think people really stop to  think about is how companies making lots of profit of obsolescence and are not being upfront about their labor force. If they were advertisments and commercials about the struggling  people making the clothes  bought from Zara  or H&M then they would think twice about purchasing the item. Besides the working injustice underpaid workers for this massively wealthy companies, the fact that these companies are markwting in a way that encourages obsolescence, which is creating a lot of more waste and emitting more greenhouse gases. I do agree that the film really opens our view to real problems and I think it is important that more people see that and become more informed.

<br><Hr>
I agree that when we are talking about climate change, we are always talking about the geographic change due to the excessive of fossil fuel. No one would believe that the fashion industry is also a big portion causing the climate crisis, and it is really hard to realize that. In addition to the climate damage of the fast fashion, I was frustrated when the film said that workers in some developing countries are squeezed in order to make a larger profit on those clothes. When the tragedy in Dhaka happened, the factory owners ignored the order to evacuate. This is actually inhumane.
<br><Hr>
I agree with your point about how when climate change is mentioned, we don't really consider the fashion and clothing industry to be part of it. Watching the documentary and show made me realize how much of a careless buyer I am. I couldn't help but feel guilty seeing the conditions in which sweatshop workers work in and finding out how little they earn. When I buy clothing I buy more than I need simply because it is cheap without considering where it was made and how companies from this cruelty. This film really made me reconsider my purchasing habits. Additionally, I really enjoyed this documentary because my parents since I was young have always stressed the importance of helping others. One way we did this was through donations. My mom would have us pick out clothes we no longer used, liked, or fit and donate them. I always assumed those clothes ended up with people who needed them, I never would have thought they could end up sitting in mounds in developing countries. Although, this documentary presents us with lots of information which can be “overwhelming” like you said, I think it is important that we know about it in order to hold ourselves accountable and change.

<br><Hr>
Wow. Just like you I never knew that fashion was the second most polluting industry to oil and I’m sure that millions of other people are still in the dark. The media most likely won’t cover it either since it could jeopardize major retailers like H&M and others which drive the fashion industry and the economy. The fact that in the 1960s we made 95 percent of our clothes and now we only make 3 percent demonstrates the scale to which our industries and strength as an international superpower have grown. The United States, through capitalism, possesses the ability to extend its powers across borders, encouraging companies to seek the most profit by taking advantage of poorer countries like Bangladesh where workers receive no protection and extremely low wages. One might expect them to find other jobs or ask for higher wages, but in doing so, the workers put their lives at risk and could drive companies away to other countries. The reality of these sweatshops is tucked deep behind the mirage of advertisements that guarantee happiness through the purchase of a product. Not only are the workers mistreated, but due to the excess amounts of wastewater, agriculture and local water reserves are contaminated, threatening the health of everyone as there are no regulations or alternatives. The negative environmental and welfare effects are endless. With the high demand for clothing and 52 fashion seasons, it seems that there is no end for the poor who suffer because of our consumer culture.

<br><Hr>
Sometimes I feel like I live in a bubble but a lot of the time I think it is by choice. When I hear about some of the things going on in the world it is almost unbearable. It is hard not to watch a documentary like this one and be completely and utterly discouraged and disgusted with humanity. So much of our system and our societies are corrupt and it is awful to watch how many innocent people suffer due to big business interests and selfish financial agendas. The companies are avoiding safety precautions to save the maximum amount of money and innocent workers are dying every year as a result. You mentioned the reaction one head of a company had which implied these jobs are helping them and almost that they should be receiving a thank you! It was fascinating to watch how the whole cycle works in the film. These workers in foreign countries receive the bare minimum pay and work in extremely dangerous environments to produce clothing for large brands who use advertising and practically propaganda to convince millions of consumers like me to continue buying their products multiple times a year. This cycle is unhealthy for people and it’s equally as unhealthy for our planet. 

     <br><br>

Your first thought was one I shared. I would not think that a class about the climate crisis would touch on the fashion industry but to learn it is number two in the most polluting industries was shocking. The industry puts so many harmful chemicals into the air and emits so many greenhouse gases, and this is in addition to requiring practically slave labor in other countries and other people spending so much of their income on unnecessary purchases. We are in need of major systemic change.

After watching the Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion by Hasan Minhaj, I was actually astounded by the numbers Mr.Minhaj was actually quoting. I've known for quite some time about the fashion industry and its tasteless connection with child labor, but I was actually surprised to find out how much of an environmental impact the fast fashion industry is forcing upon the world. A part that I really focused on was when Minhaj highlighted the fact that it took years of drinking water to make Ansel Elgort's sweater, like legitimately years of drinking water. Even after watching the humorous show, I still can't really comprehend how this much water necessarily correlates to creating a sweater. Another thing that really popped up to me was when Minhaj was talking about how these fast fashion brands are creating fake environmental lines just so they can get the public to think they are making effort to reduce waste. Annual reports are unnecessarily long and confusing on purpose to lose the focus of potential readers while ads explaining that said company is eco-friendly are often vague and hold no real information to them at all. From a consumer standpoint, I guess I never really wondered about where the clothing would go if the donation does not work out. I arbitrarily assumed that all donated clothing could be used somehow and really put my mind and focus more on the idea that donating is good then the assumption that buying so many clothes is bad and especially detrimental to the environment. Overall, I really liked this section of the Patriot Act from Hasan Minhaj as I appreciated his humor as it helped me pay more attention to what he was trying to explain as I was captured by his natural charisma.

Ken's outline of the conditioning process to produce another generation of consumers, especially targeted at women, made me truly sad. Women are taught to believe that products will generate their "womanhood," which is completely wrong. Having watched The True Cost last quarter, I haven't been able to view fashion the same. I cringe when one of my friends buys new clothes on impulse or because it's trendy--that's a bit harsh, I know. We're all used to buying without considering what it took to make an item, let alone how long we will keep it. Thinking more broadly, who wants to be trapped in the temporary fulfillment and expensive cycle of purchasing materials to establish an image of who you are? The True Cost encouraged me to really consider the worthiness of an item before buying, as well as buy second hand. You'd be surprised by the items you could find in a thrift store: some may be familiar brands or still have the original tag on it. 

     <br><br>

The Patriot Act episode was a great episode to get the word out about fast fashion. It's funny, keeps you on your toes, makes interesting comparisons and explains astonishing statistics. After watching it, I sent the link to friends who also are making sustainable efforts. I believe that the episode was effective because it called out real brands. Zara and H&M are only two of the biggest fast fashion industries running companies like Levi's and Gap out of business in the most unsustainable and deceiving way possible. Their "eco-friendly" lines are ploys to keep customers with great intentions in the dark and trapped. People normally don't read into the company to find out the logistics, but that's because we think these companies are true to their word. The public has good intentions, but money has made monsters, especially within these companies.

The video, "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" Hassan Minhaj, discusses the the facts behind the fast fashion market with a comedic approach. After watching this video, I realized I previously had some knowledge of these facts and have led me to live my life the way I have been for the past couple years. I used to be always on top with keeping up with the newest fashion, but for the last couple of years I've stopped. After previous years of always keeping up with the newest thing I realized the price point for what I was paying did not match my standard of quality for the product. So, these past few years, whenever I need to buy something new I tend to research the quality of clothing. It was reassuring to hear Minhaj's solution of simply wearing your clothes more and not buying so many new items.

The fast fashion industry is by far the primary enabler to the horrible conditions millions of people in third world countries like Cambodia and Bangladesh are subjected to.  While watching “The True Cost” there was no doubt in my mind that America’s economic system of consumer capitalism was the driving factor behind the fast fashion industry and the effects it was having on both human rights and the environment.  As a consumer myself, I would like to think I take no responsibility when it comes to seeing the horrible effects of the fashion industry.  I would like to believe that I am only consuming because corporations are forcing me and everyone around me to do so.  However, although these large corporations take a majority of the blame, we as consumers must take some responsibility ourselves by resisting the urges to buy into the growing fast fashion industry.  Witnessing the aftermath of events like the Rana Plaza incident really put my choices as an American consumer into perspective.  Every time I buy from brands like Forever 21, H&M or Zaful, I always try to think about exactly who and what sourced this product.  Even though I am aware it was probably sourced in a third world country under terrible working conditions, I have the tendency to eventually disregard it because I’d rather not come to terms with the consequences of my purchases.  However, going forward knowing the specifics of where the fashion industry derives their products, I will attempt to make more conscious efforts in my shopping habits and encourage others around me to do the same.  Overall, the biggest unsurprising takeaway I gained from this film was the disappointment I felt in America’s tendencies to take advantage of impoverished countries in which have no set rules or regulations for their workers.  The driving forces behind these tendencies are solely driven by consumer capitalism and the vicious cycle that fast fashion enables.

Before watching "The True Cost," I can honestly but sadly say that I have been a mindless consumer all my life. Ever since I was younger, I have been obsessed with getting the newest and greatest thing I'd see on commercials. I would save up my money to buy it, and eventually repeat the same process. As I've grown older, my desires have shifted from toys to clothing. 
     <br><br>


I have always appreciated fashion and have even put myself into debt to keep up with the trends. Buying a piece of clothing I had wanted for an extended period brings me immense joy, as it does similarly to many of my counterparts. However, this desire of mine results in many unworn outfits sitting in my closet, waiting to be touched. To feel better about my bad habit, I donate or sell these items of clothing to thrift stores and donation centers. In addition, much of my wardrobe is secondhand, which makes me feel a little better about the money I spend on clothes. However, I was shocked to hear such a small percentage of the clothes at these donation centers and thrift stores are actually resold. 

     <br><br>

Thinking back on my past purchases, I am slightly ashamed. I had never taken into account how each piece of clothing was made: by the hardworking hands of deprived women, men, and children of third-world countries. It is absolutely repulsive to think about large corporations taking advantage of these helpless people, as well as my contribution to this factor. From now on, I hope to limit my consumerist desire and shop secondhand when I wish to shop. Shopping at and supporting these corporations is equally as corrupt as the actions of these corporations in regards to labor.

I completely agree. Unfortunately, I believe that companies have shaped us all into mindless consumers, waiting for the newest product. I completely understand the joy experienced when a piece of clothing is bought. I always prided myself in donating my clothes when I no longer used them, but realizing the small percent that is actually resold by thrift stores was shocking and depressing. It makes me feel so much regret when I look back at all the useless purchases I have made, then donated, after barely being worn. 
     <br><br>

When I think about the racks after racks of colorful two dollar tank tops at almost every department store, I am repulsed. Now, I know where these are made, and the horrible conditions the women making them are subject to. It is not ethical in any way for people to be subject to dangerous or unhealthy working conditions (especially when it is brought to the attention of the managers that there are infrastructure problems, and the women are still forced to work.) 
     <br><br>

Consumers must be made aware of the fact that their clothes come from exploited workers. These films need to be seen by a wider audience.

The documentary "The True Cost" really opened my eyes. It is my first time to see what is going on behind those fast fashion brands. I was shocked when I saw the Rana Plaza disaster, people were buried under cement and died. Another part of the film that shocks me is that, in the city of Phnom Penh, many clothes factory workers who demanded an increase in minimum wages in Cambodia were injured or even killed by the riot polices. I could see a man was lying on the ground with a shirt steeped with blood. I was like a war, a battleground. As it was mentioned in the documentary, the wages of those clothes factory workers was less than three dollars per day, and they still had to raise their children. Although the price of commodities in Cambodia is much lower than that of the United States, that is still really difficult and kind of impossible. In India, as I saw that some kids were suffering from congenital disability because of the externalities of the production of cotton while the only thing their parents could do is to wait for the deaths of their children since they were too poor to save them, I wish the government do something to give them a hand.

I agree that it is extremely startling to see what is happening in third world companies due to our fashion industries. It is shocking the amount of suffering these people in Bangladesh, Cambodia and other countries are enduring just so we as Americans can wear cheap clothes. The disease the chemicals bring, the wasted materials that destroy the environment, the lack of capital that leaves people starving and in unsafe working conditions; all of it is unacceptable. I liked the saying “where is their slice of the pie” because none of us see it. The whole video made me feel oblivious. Sure, I heard a little about it in the news, but apparently it didn’t cover enough of the issue to make that big of an impact on me or else I would be stating I already knew these things happen. If more people knew about this sort of social injustice that we are a part of, you would hear more people speaking up. I am sorry, but the whole saying of how we are developing these countries is bull. If we really wanted to help we could lend aid, teach other skills or at the very least pay those laborers what they deserve to be paid. It is despicable that big name companies  who already have enough money, take advantage of those who have no other option, but to comply to help support their family. Those workers are working more than us, away from their family for nearly the whole year, yet are getting paid less than a fraction of what we make, try to convince me that that is what we as Americans want to encourage.

Similarly to you as I watched “The True Cost” it was shocking, and only got more shocking to watch the further we got into it. One of the things that got me the most was Shima’s story. In the end as she leaves her daughter with relatives for her to go work, she cries as she states that no one should be wearing the clothes that have cost them their lives. Shima explained how she had tried to tell her managers in the factory that they should be paid better, and in turn they got locked in and beat. Comparing that to the way in which factory workers got beat up and shot in the police riots for asking minimum wage also shows that these workers in 3W nations are trapped by the fashion industry. 
     <br><br>
I appreciated that they included Vandana Shiva in the film. The way she explains the way the industry works in places like India where first world nations don’t care about the people, the environment and the way in which they disrupt everything. How industries come and take a farmer’s land because they are “in debt” to them causing these farmers to commit suicide with pesticides and having their wives find them in the fields… Shiva explaining exactly how the pesticides work, and then a doctor confirming that these toxic chemicals cause many health problems for the people in the village. It was heartbreaking to see that mothers of kids who suffered from the pesticides accepted and await the death of their children who never got a chance of living.
<br><hr>

I think that honestly, the worst part of this documentary for me, is I wasn’t surprised by any of it. I’ve been hearing about the horrors of fast fashion in the news for years, and resorted to thrifting in early high school. These people are being paid pennies to make clothes that cost more than everything they own, including their property. I know so many people who turn their head away from these disasters of human ethics and continue to buy brands that invest in third world sweatshops. Like, for god’s sake, these people who make our hundred dollar clothing can’t even afford to save their children from the conditions they were exposed to at work. It’s truly disgusting. These companies should have to give every penny and every garment back to the workers, and their supporters should explain to the dying children why their designer shirt was worth it.
     <br><br>
People and the Earth are dying and American consumerism eggs it on. It’s time for it to stop. We can avoid fast fashion and all this blood on our hands. I dream of a world soon where people wear what they like instead of what’s popular. I want more individuality in our world. I want less selfishness. Why are our goods worth others’ lives?

The saying “Human consumption is what empowers them” Ken mentions in the video resonates with my thought so hard. I totally agree with how consumerism is rising as people demand all the goods, no matter if it’s a necessity or a luxury. To explain, human consumption, or in other words, customer needs, are the primary reason for “them,” the producers, to increase their production and its quality. Since we pay for the stuff we purchase, producers, or sellers, are required to exist and to survive through means of providing supplies or items for people. This further demonstrates that it’s the CUSTOMERS who should take responsibility for the consumptions. Take me as an example. Even though I’m not addicted to buying cosmetics, it is easy for me to get attracted to the ads whenever I see them on social media. And since it’s so convenient to buy things online, it’s absolutely inevitable to exit the webpage or not buy anything after seeing it. Almost every time I would end up buying a small number of cosmetics that I feel regret and unnecessary. After I received the packages, I would just leave the cosmetics I seldom use in my drawers until the expiration date. This is what Ken said as a result, people dispose and bring needless consumption, or carbon dioxide emission. Therefore, I often try to tell myself to learn from the experiences and stop being attracted by the ads and the reviews so easily. Similarly, on Black Friday or holidays, shops provide discounts for customers, resulting in consumers buying plenty of clothes just because they are cheap. This thought related to consumerism should be completely changed. Although ads are made to make the sellers profits, this should not be an effective method for both sides, and in particular, it’s a huge impact on our planet. The world is operated in a system in which people serve each other. Hence, we should not be blaming every one of us but instead, think about what you yourself can contribute or make changes first.

I agree with the point you made about the consumers being at blame. After all, we are still enabling these companies. I don't believe it's one hundred percent on the customers. Ken mentioned something along the lines of, cosmetic companies are no longer simply making cosmetics, but they are also breeding young kids into consumers. This is why I see the blame split. We are to blame because we are fueling the fast fashion industry through our mass consumption. It might be easy to simply tell people to stop buying things, but when companies have been targeting people from a young age, it's hard to break that conditioning. The conditioning that companies use puts some of the blame on them. I think that as consumers, especially in the modern age with the vast resources available to us, have a responsibility to consume responsibly. Only what we need, only from sustainable sources. I know it sounds difficult or possibly more expensive, but if what the corporations claim is true, we have the power. We can determine what gets made and how it is made through the choices we make when consuming.

I watched "The True Cost" and it was eyeopening. I knew that sweatshops were a thing, and was aware of the horrible conditions. What was most troubling to me was the monopoly of seeds. Monsanto has a sort of monopoly on seeds. Something so fundamental to the poorer farming areas is now being exploited. Not only this, but they are genetically modifying them, which is a two fold problem. First off, the seeds themselves become more expensive. More importantly, they are being modified to withstand pesticides. This means farmers can use more pesticides without losing crops. The more you use pesticides, the more you need next time. This just means farmers are being made to consume more and more pesticides, which begins to leave residuals in the soil and water. It was sad to see all the effects this was having on the population around the large farms. All these side effects require large sums of money to treat. Money these farmers don't have after spending them on the seeds. It seems to be a vicious cycle.

The film began with one quote that rang with me, "It [clothing] is the skin we choose." I think this is a large part of why people buy so many clothes, more than we have opportunity to wear, more than what we need on a daily basis, more than what we would even wear. Some clothes are even bought just for the sake of buying it, to soothe our own pain or sadness. This quote sums up why so many of us think that clothes are a part of our definition. What we put on on the outside can show something we want people to see. It can also hide things that we don't want people to see. This is why clothes are such a large part of our lives, and why we are mass consumers of the fashion industry.
     <br><br>
But if we strip all this way, back to what clothes were originally defined as, just pieces of fabric to provide warmth for our bodies, we will be able to cut back our consumption of clothing. We can also cut back consumption by changing even the trend of consuming and the advertising techniques that are used. 
     <br><br>
As a clothing lover myself, I believe that we owe this change to the millions of people that are suffering behind each piece of clothing we buy. The outsourced production to India, Africa, Cambodia, are all causing pain and suffering to the people employed at underpaid garment factories. Even though their only objective is to earn money to survive, they are subjected to unfair working conditions, little pay, and unsafe working environments, all at the expense of the cheaper clothing that we buy. The Rana Plaza and garment factory disasters in Bangladesh, and the RT cotton pollution in India only scratch the surface of these disasters. There are still many dark sides of the fashion industry left untouched, and we as consumers, need to understand more clearly about the things we consume.

I think you make an excellent point in your comment. That quote is extremely powerful. It drives the whole fashion industry, as people strive to buy the newest, fanciest clothing items in hope of impressing those around them. Coming from a wealthy area, I have seen this firsthand. A name- brand company drops a new line of clothing, and those all around me race to be the first ones to start wearing it. What we don't realize is it truly doesn't make a difference. Sure, it is nice to occasionally get something new and change your look a bit, but is it worth the cost. I think part of the issue is outsourcing. Since we are far away from some of those poorer areas that are responsible for making the clothes, we can't truly grasp the severity of the situation. This film did a great job giving us a sneak peek into these situations, from the horrible working conditions to the greed of the people in charge. Hopefully, as more people witness the situation behind this production of clothes, they will begin to see that there are more important things then a pair of new jeans.

I really like that you started this comment with that quote "It [clothing] is the skin we choose" because it really emphasizes the role that clothing plays in todays society. I think that so many people, even myself included just like you said you are, enjoy clothing and everything that comes with getting new clothing. However, I also agree heavily with the later section of your comment that says talked about the cutting back of our spending on clothing because of the havoc that it wreaks on the people who are not benefiting because of the clothes we choose to buy. By this I am referring to the people suffering unfair working conditions, little pay, and unsafe working environments etc... 
     <br><br>
However, as much as I believe we need to make a change to stop this I believe it is much too idealistic to think that this can change anytime soon. Clothing has become so ingrained in the lives of us Americans and so many others around the world I just do not see a major change happening anytime soon that could combat this type of materialism. I would be all for improving this issue myself, but like many others unless there were more people doing it my change alone would, in my mind, not contribute enough to cause me to want to start solving the problem on my own. I fully understand society as a whole would have to not hold selfish opinions such as mine, however I will likely hold this pessimistic view until I see consumerism and materialistic values starting to change.

I have never seen the film “The True Cost” before. But I was astonished after watching it. I didn't know fashion industry could have so much bad influence on our environment and society. I saw images from all around the world. People in developing countries suffer the most. They helped developed countries in making products. However, many of them were sick because of the waste and toxic chemicals we produced. When I saw so many children fell ill in the movie, I was shocked. I could not believe the fashion industry would have such a big impact on these poor people. This film changed my view about fashion industry. I think we all have responsibilities to improve the situation in developing countries. People who live in these countries suffered a lot due to our behaviors. So we must take actions immediately.

I definitely agree that the environmental impact not just to the people who are directly affected by the toxic chemicals, but also the global impact of fast fashion is insurmountable. The process from beginning to end is entirely submerged in the economic prosperity of fast fashion brands. With a blatant disregard for human health and the general well being of others, the fast fashion industry profits tremendously. The true cost made me look at the disposal of clothes in a very different light, the general population is seemingly unaware of the environmental cost of donating clothes to charity. Knowing now that most of the clothes end up in a landfill somewhere and not biodegrade for centuries is incredibly disheartening. What affected me most, as you mentioned earlier was, the treatment of unskilled women in sweatshops around the world having their human rights violated. Seeing potentially millions of  people around the world having hazardous work environments along with low pay, and their environmental consequences of such actions is reprehensible.

Having watched "The True Cost" last quarter, I watched the video from "The Patriot Act" which detailed the issues with fast fashion. What I was surprised to see was the :The Patriot Act actually referenced "The True Cost" as a source of information. Along with this many of the facts listed about fast fashion by Hasan Minhaj were the same as those listed in "The True Cost". The use of comedy by Minhaj helped draw interest to his argument and encouraged listeners to take accountability for their consumer issues. Fashion is an interesting topic as it is really the main we we describe yourself to complete strangers. An issue that arises because of this is that people change their identities and personalities throughout their lives and as a result they get rid of clothes and buy new ones. However, the fashion industry is only one of the businesses that profits from the destruction of our environment, and once again the power to stop this from happening is in the consumers hands. If consumers refuse to purchase fast fashion and choose to buy from true seasonal brands or even better purchase used clothes then as a global community we would be better off. Another step we could take would be to reuse the clothing we still have and re purpose them for other uses.  Overall Fast fashion errors more parties than it benefits therefore consumers should step up and influence businesses to change their practices.

opted for Patriot Act : The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion as this weeks screening because I have found myself at fault of questioning whether I have “cool” enough or simply enough clothing at times. Although I have drastically changed my consuming habits when it comes to fast fashion and overall purchasing clothing, I am nowhere near where I’d like to be in terms of how much or how it is I consume fashion. As a kid I was always interested in clothing, fashion and trends so I have been aware of the process and production structure it takes for garments to reach our hands, at a very young age. There are so many negative impacts that fast fashion has on our environment, waste of resources, unequal/child labor, cost of production and outsourcing are all aspects we must admit we have contributed to. Unfortunately, our culture pushes clothing through advertising which closely relates what we wear to how it is we should feel about ourselves and one another. Although fast fashion is so closely related to the issue of climate change, I finding it a bit funny and of course upsetting how hypocritical people of my age are when it comes to this subject. I often hear others debate how it is they are taking more sustainable actions like, consuming less meat or remembering to bring their grocery bag all while wearing and being proactive consumers of large fast fashion corporations. Although I do not discredit anyones attempt to bettering their choices for the sake of our environment, it does bother me that others don’t correlate what they’re wearing to the problem of climate change. As consumers of fast fashion, we have to consider that what we are wearing is a product of someone’s labor, direct use of our resources (oil, water, etc) and that the overall production of our garments had a negative affect on many including ourselves. I’m glad Hasan Minhaj touched on greenwashing as I believe we should all have a problem with companies who tell us they’re doing better when in fact they are the root of the problem. Adding to this I’d like to mention an overwhelming tactic that fast fashion brands use and that is destroying their own clothing, for it to remain “exclusive” or valuable to the ones who do purchase.

People nowadays are driven by different types of advertisement on telling them what is the trend of fashion and what we should buy and what to wear so we would look good.
     <br><br>
We as the people living in developed countries have a high consumption rate and we care about materialism that we keep spending money on buying stuff we don’t actually need.
     <br><br>
I think this documentary is a great one because it leads me to see the true cost: cost of the environment and costs of the poor countries(cheap laborer) people’s lives, health and equal opportunities.
     <br><br>
When we are spending money on buying clothes, most people don’t really see the real need for the clothes. We bought clothes sometimes not because we lack of clothes but simply we want more. And it comes out that we haven’t really worn them many times before we throw it away and simply feels like it doesn’t look good/not in the fashion trend anymore. The cost imposed on our environment is huge as many of those waste don’t go away for years and years. And when we are happily spending the money, we don’t realize the poor and cheap laborers behind the production of the clothes we wear. It is extremely sad to see how people are still earning such a low wage and don’t have a safe working environment.
     <br><br>
After watching the documentary, I think we should start seriously concerning and look at the consumption problem to reduce the waste it produced that might pollute our environment and to make an equal and a better opportunity for those laborers from poor countries as they have no differences from us.

A lot of people don’t have it in them to care about climate change and the environmental effects. However, the practices that cause climate change have many other terrible effects that are not climate-related. This film studies the fashion industry and examines its ill effects. The production of American goods has been outsourced to low-cost economies where wages are disgustingly low and the laws and standards are weak. This takes away any potential for economic growth in these poor countries. It causes the destruction of soil by chemicals. It brings high death rates, high illness and mental retardation rates, and high suicide rates. It takes away from quality of life, as the factory workers and farmers are forced to work incredibly long hours. In many cases, this means that these workers are forced to leave their kids with family and friends outside of the city, only seeing them a couple times a year. It is already hard for me to grasp that so many people in our country don’t understand how drastic this climate crisis is. But hopefully, these people will be able to understand how gross and sad it is that American fashion is abusing millions of people on the other side of the world.

This documentary is really impressive and it helps me to figure out the true cost behind the good. Just as what the last documentary mentioned, electric car is not really environmental friendly if we count on the pollution made by the production process. Similarly, the truth behind the consumerism and fast fashion in the modern society is that many poor people suffer from it. They work on industry in poor condition for supporting the modern fashion. Pessimistically, labors in these types of industry live in poor condition as well. They produce clothes for other countries and help to make the industry thrive, but there is nothing to do with themselves. Even after working for more than 10 hours every day, these workers are still poor, What makes things worse is that working in these industry is risky and harmful to their body. Many workers in this industry get injured and even handicapped just for making a living. The working environment will hurt they lungs and other body organs in a long term, even if they do not take any physical injury. When this happens, no one will take responsibility for them, what they can get is just the decent compensation and going home (since they cannot continue to work with disability). It’s a sad story, and there are rarely solution towards it, because all this types of workers count on this industry to feed up their family.

After watching The True Cost, I learned that in the past few decades, the clothing industry has transformed into a three billion dollar industry that employs one out of six people in the world. Clothing manufacturing has become a globalized production and is now frequently outsource to developing countries where wages are low and there are minimal regulations protecting worker’s rights. In these developing countries, it is easy for clothing corporations to cut corners and neglect safety. This was exemplified in the 2013 Rana Plaza incident, in which an eight-story garment factory collapsed. Over 1000 people were buried alive or killed. The collapse caused structural cracks, which were pointed out on numerous occasions before, yet still not repaired. I looked into the Rana Plaza incident and learned that collapse was also because the owner illegally added three extra floors to the building to make more profits. The clothing industry is a prime example of a social injustice issue. I was shocked to learn that there are roughly 40 million garment workers and one-tenth of them work in Bangladesh. Garment workers in Bangladesh earn less than three dollars a day and are some of the lowest-paid garment workers in the world. 
     <br><br>


The only reason that these workers continue to work in inhumane working conditions is because affluent people continue to purchase fast fashion items. This documentary opened my eyes to the impact I have with every single item I buy; I truly vote with my dollar. People need to be more informed of the consequences of their purchases. But more importantly, we need to change the way our economy functions. Our economy is currently based on consumer capitalism and materialism and as a result, we are continually purchasing items at the example of the people making these goods and at the expense of our happiness. As Martin Luter King stated, “we need a revolution of values” and our economy should reflect these values.

The True Cost was effective at communicating its subject because it interviewed real people who are struggling around the world from the production of fast fashion. It explained the issue from how it started and how bad it has become. Not all of the people interviewed saw fast fashion as entirely a bad thing, such as economists or advertisers who defended the industry and how it works. There were a lot of different viewpoints to show all of the different sides and issues surrounding fast fashion. I think the audience would be a mix of people interested and casual viewers. I think the film was made for people who have no idea what fast fashion is or why it's bad. Primarily, my reaction to the film was emotional. The film made me really upset. I was unaware of how bad the human rights issues were behind fast fashion and that part hit me hard. I've been planning on ditching fast fashion for a while now and this film made me feel even more disgusted with fast fashion and determined to only buy second hand clothes. I learned about the human effects of fast fashion in 3rd world countries. I was unaware of how bad that side of it was. The film made me feel a little bit discouraged because it is such a massive problem and not enough people know about the problem and big corporations rule the world. I have already recommended it to a bunch of my friends, they need to know about this worldwide issue.

Hasan Minhaj never fails to make an extremely entertaining and logical agenda when discussing issues we face. It was shocking that fast fashion is so detrimental to the Earth, but at the same time it is some what expected. I think it is really strange that even though many of us are aware that every product we purchase or use probably has an adverse effect on the Earth, we continue to support these businesses anway. To me, it is scary just HOW much power big business and fast fashion has over us. Not only physically but psychologically. Dozens and hundreds of statements and research show how horrible the industry is, yet we all continue to support these organizations who are ultimately doing more harm than good. i thought it was interesting because Hasan obviously participates in fast fashion, and unfortunately all of us pretty much do too. Although it would take time to shy away from the trend of fast fashion, that does not mean that jsut because you have a lot of clothing alreasy, that you cannot start to move towards the second-hand lifestyle. 68 new pieces of clothing IN ONE YEAR. That number is insanely high! More articles of clothing are bought on average than weeks in a year. I believe fast fashion is ultimately a deeply rooted psychological issue more than anything, Americans are wired to buy, buy, buy, and buy some more. Our money has power and the only way to stop big companies like H&M is to pay attention to where we spend our dollars

The film “The True Cost” gave me an interesting insight into the world of fast fashion and consumerism. Of course, I was shocked to see images of the people in Bangladesh and Dhaka who were hurt physically and emotionally by the fast fashion industry; many were killed, hurt, diseased, and overall paid a poor sum for all that they went through for other people to consume these goods. When Ken’s lecture video asked if we think it is the companies or the people who are responsible for consumerism, I had to think for a minute. Of course the consumers are responsible because we are the ones that keep buying and buying these goods, but we are also the ones who have the power to stop companies from producing so much and causing great harm. A notable quote from the film was “advertising is a category of propaganda”. I found this important when answering Ken’s question, because this leads me to believe that it is indeed the companies who are responsible for consumerism. If companies didn’t come out with something new every week and advertise it on huge platforms, people would probably be buying less. Clearly, the fashion industry is harmful, not only to the people who are working directly in it, but also to the Earth; the film mentions that the fashion industry is the second most polluting industry in the world. In order to stop this pollution, we as consumers need to stop buying into these companies.

There is no doubt that the fashion industry is enormously harmful. When the film mentioned that the fashion industry was the second most polluting industry in the world, right behind the oil industry I wasn't surprised at all. Before attending UCSB I wasn't aware of how detrimental the industry was, I wasn't aware of the exploitation that these garment workers undergo on a daily basis just to provide us greedy Americans with materialistic stuff that we think we need but we actually don't. Up until I took a feminist studies class during my winter quarter of my first year at UCSB I was educated on this matter. The course focused on the development impact and globalization on specifically the lives of women in third world countries, working in terribly conditioned factories while being underpaid. While gaining knowledge on this matter it made me extremely angry as i'm sure it would make any moral person feel the same way. Going back to the film, “The True Cost”, the ending was very devastating for me to take in. The clips they showed of the public going absolutely insane for these materialistic products, fighting each other over a pair of shoes, over a shirt, over products that don’t even matter - then switching the scene, showing clips of these hard workers who are constantly exploited in underdeveloped countries just completely crushed me. Too many Americans are unaware of the exploitation of garment workers and it is just embarrassing. We need to know where the clothes on our backs are coming from, from the industrious hands of underpaid workers, working in unsafe factories. Maybe if more people were aware of this, things will start to change in the right direction--one can only hope.
<br><hr>
I think the companies have a big role in persuading the consumer to buy their products. Yes we are the people who buy the products but without the companies promoting their new products all the time the consumers would never want to buy them, I actually believe that we would be content with the product we have already. As we learned previously these companies care more about their products selling and keeping a good image than climate change. I think if the consumers stop buying into these companies we would eliminate a lot of labor abuse and climate change will decrease since the fashion industry is the 2nd largest polluter. One way we can fix this is by buying your clothes from a thrift shop. Nowadays thrifting is becoming more and more popular and trendy which is good for the environment. Ken mentioned before that buying used clothes is a good step in containing climate change.

The film conveyed its subject very clearly and effectively through interviewing some of the most influential people who are aware of and care about the negative results caused by fast fashion in areas including agriculture, economics, etc. Moreover, the filmmakers incorporated some records of what life is like for people living in the bottom of the supply chain and what these people think or feel about the situation they are facing. Incidents like collapse of Rana Plaza are mentioned as proofs to the subject as well. I was shocked by what this film exposes about fast fashion at the beginning. Then I started to consider what consequences such overproduction would lead to. I thought about what I could do to get involved in improving the situation and whether the Congress would issue new legislations accordingly to regulate production. Before watching the film, I did know that there are many people worldwide suffering from poverty for various reasons, but I never thought that fast fashion would ever have such a huge impact on those people. I never thought that the clothes we wear everyday could be made out of someone’s life and blood and at the cost of catastrophic environmental problems. Just by looking at those polluted rivers that used to be clean and support local people’s basic needs and the children who are suffering from mental retardation or cancers caused by harmful chemicals emitted by production, I can sense the how toughly they are struggling under the suppression and exploitation of the business giants and local governors. Fortunately, I’m not the type of person who would buy a brand new shirt only for a party; at least, I’m not currently contributing that much to the damage of lives who live in the bottom of the supply chain. However, this film indeed warns me about what I should be careful with in the future. In addition, I am aware that I should inform people around me about the tough situation faced by not only people at the bottom of the supply chain, but also the globe as a whole. After watching the film, I really felt pessimistic, not only because of the emotional impact of watching people worldwide suffering under the surface of a thriving global economy, but also the essential problems and weaknesses the whole system has.

I really enjoyed watching “The Ugly Cost of Fast Fashion”, once again it opened my eyes on the hidden industries that are greatly contributing to the climate crisis. When we have discussions about climate change and how one can lower their own carbon footprint, we talk about cars, and driving less, or the meat industry, and switching to mostly plant based diets, but rarely fashion. Just like the lecture video this week, it made me think about my own actions, because I am very much so sucked into the consumerism society, and fast fashion, but was not super educated on the impact it has. I constantly catch myself buying the newest things because of all the fast fashion ads I see daily, like on Instagram. But personally, I am slightly optimistic for the future, because thrift shopping is becoming more and more popular, and is starting to be seen as the “cool” and “trendy” thing to do, plus it is inexpensive. After watching this episode I will definitely be more aware of what I am buying and how many new things I am buying, and get the stuff I absolutely need, not necessarily want. 
     <br><br>

Personally I think to educate people on this topic and many other environmental topics in the population we should do it through short episodes, like in “The Ugly Cost of Fash Fashion”, with humor, rather than the long and serious documentary, The True Cost. Short, fast, to-the-point, funny episodes are much more effective, I believe. The audience can laugh and also get the facts straight up, without the feeling of being attacked. Also by being short one will not lose their attention span and are more likely to sit down and start some that is only 30 minutes rather than something that is 2 hours; at least I know I am. I alway opt to watch a 30 minute episode versus a 2 hour movie, it seems to always fit better in my schedule, and seems like less of a commitment. After watching I became more aware of the destruction fast fashion has on this environment and I am committed to being more conscious about my decisions when it comes to buying new clothing.

I definitely agree with most of your statements but the one that stood out most to me was that you were more likely to sit down and watch a 30 minute video rather than have to sit through a whole 2 documentary. Also I too liked how the video contained humor and was short, it helped me pay attention longer and actually retain some of the statistics. I enjoyed how Hasan Minhaj made me laugh while actually discussing a serious topic. The long documentaries we’ve watched in this class are effective in convincing the viewer but only if they closely follow along. That’s the problem with these long, in depth films. They’re boring. So Hasan’s little video was quite a breath of fresh air. I think my favorite part of his video was when he opened his “own” little pop-up store that was filled with “eco-friendly” clothes from brands like H&M or Zara. These brands do a great job of pretending to care about the environment but they’re really just trying to make a dollar. I can’t believe they are allowed to trick customers like they have been doing such as by putting that they cut out water from the dying process even though that certain step doesn’t even need that much water.

Coming into watching this film I already had an idea, sadly, of what was about to be said. The cost of clothing, name brand or not, is being paid for by the lowest class of society and our selfish need to express ourselves with unreasonable merchandise set at high prices makes the lives of those workers worse. The film was very effective at making its point by showing real insight from the places of work to portraying opinions of those in the higher and middle classes that are completely ignorant to the suffering behind their clothing. Being that the film is trying to make change for those suffering in the clothing industry the film targets wealthier classes  because those are the consumers and also the people that could dramatically make a difference. The film also targets the big clothing companies by putting their bad habits on blast for the world to see and understand, making it harder for them to get away with "murder". The film made me feel guilty; after watching it I began evaluating how I was contributing to the crisis in my own ways. I felt enlightened and have been keeping my eye out for things that represent the film in my everyday life. I learned that it was actually bad to buy cheap clothing. I didn't realize how bad exactly the lower prices affected the workers of the industry and how by buying cheap clothes could actually result in making someone else life miserable.  I feel optimistic about what the film could do and its purpose/ how it will change my life but it makes me pessimistic thinking back to other classes I have taken, the effect big companies have over the world worries me when presented with the idea that they could easily find a way around rules and regulations. The film itself deserves 5 stars solely based on its purpose, I believe that if enough people watched the film a big difference could be made. i have already recommended the film to two friends and one of them enjoyed it very much.

 Similar to your case, I too understood what was about to be said. Although I had already known that world’s major clothing companies exploit the cheap labor of people from poor countries, “The True Cost” was simultaneously saddening and infuriating. I am angry because how dare the wealthiest companies turn us (those producing our clothes & me and you-the consumers) into pawns merely for a game that only truly benefits those on top. I am completely at a loss for words for the millions of people who have work in the factories, live near the factories, and have lived lives that endure unbelievable atrocities. I was near tears at many points in the film. 
     <br><br>

I felt guilty as well. Having watched “The Minimalists” and now this film, part of me wanted to pause the movie and go through the abundance of clothes I own and get them ready for donation. But I now know that donating doesn’t do much help either. This film along with the minimalism film made me take a closer look at the accumulation of stuff and I will definitely be changing my relationship to buying things.

I watched "The Ugly Truth o Fast Fashion" and I found it to be really entertaining and interesting. I watched "The True Cost" and I thought that this video was going to border line repeat everything I had already learned from the film; but that wasn't the case. Hasan Minhaj (the comedian host of the video) really connected with the audience through his jokes, while at the same time shocking the audience with statistics about the clothing industry. He would make a smart remark on Zara and H & M, but then right after he would say how during the holiday shopping season Americans are expected to spend $1 trillion and calling it a shopping "high." His jokes made me want to listen to everything he said, because at times when someone just gives you a list of statistics you get bored and lose focus, but Hasan kept his audience attention and showed visualizations of the problems we are facing. He talked about Zara's influence on the fast industry, and the production process and at the end he left off on a good note by telling us what we need to do. 
     <br><br>
Now, I know the first time I learned about how my shopping "high" caused serious damage to earth, I thought to myself "so what am I never suppose to buy clothes again?" and I felt bad but I knew that would be a hard task for me personally. However, this video gave me two solutions: "just by wearing your clothes for 9 months longer, it can reduce your carbon footprint for that garment by 30%" and "if everyone bought one used item this year, instead of new, it could save nearly 6 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions; which is equivalent to removing half a million cars off the road for a year." I was shocked with these facts and glad that I don't have to give up shopping all together. Plus, I love thrift shopping and honestly it's a lot cheaper too, and I get more compliments on my thrift clothes than my brand new clothes! Also, instead of throwing away clothes, I hand it down to my sister (plus if I change my mind and want to wear it again I just take it back) and that extends the "timeline" of my clothes. Overall, I thought it would be hard to give up my shopping addiction, but there's always a better way to go about things. I have learned a lot from this video.

Okay to begin with, I’ve been saying that capitalism is not this “great thing” that everyone is die hard sold on. We’ve been taught that the only correct economic system is capitalism and if we criticize this system or voice a dissenting opinion we are shunned by our peers and declared: unpatriotic, traitor, ungrateful — unamerican. The film, “The True Cost” highlights the various problems that stem from our entrenched belief of consumerism and materialism. Fast fashion, the product of consumer capitalism, is now a 35 billion dollar annual business that has numerous social and environmental effects. The result of our consumer culture leads to companies like H&M and Zara to outsource their manufacturing to countries such as Bangladesh because they can find the lowest minimum wage and these countries do not follow/enforce safety regulations. These European and American companies continuously seek out the lowest price and continue to tell sweatshop managers if they do not lower the price they will take their business elsewhere. This leads to millions of poor people in developing countries being treated as slaves to the western capitalist culture. This absolutely disgusts me. Also, these companies do not actually own any of these factories so they are not held accountable for their workers and they are left off the hook. These workers get paid as little as $10 per month and work long hours. Various harmful chemicals are used and expose these workers to dangerous health complications. Parents can’t afford to raise their children so they send them to the countryside to be raised by friends and family. An example of how these health and human rights regulations were ignored is the tragedy of Rana Plaza. In this sweatshop over 1000 people died when an eight story building collapsed even though workers were voicing their distress about all the cracks and crumbling of walls. This could have been prevented but the manager made them work in fear of losing business to the west. At the end of the film various leaders and economists state how to solve this environmental and human injustice we need to change our culture and criticize our economic system. As Professor Ken said we need to change the “American Dream” and our capitalist culture because our obsession with materialism is making the Earth uninhabitable. Some ways to do that is to not shop at these big brand name stores, shop at local thrift stores. Vote with your wallet.

I completely agree with what you have to say and criticize about the fashion industry. I am not big omg fashion and keeping up with the 52 new "seasons" of fashion these days so I never looked much into it but The True Cost highlighted things that I never would have known about the industry without watching it. Thew amount of people that die or obtain serious health issues because of the fashion industry is outright DISGUSTING. Seeing the video clips of when that building collapsed and of the children who have birth defects and mental illnesses from the chemicals their PARENTS have breathed in their whole life was absolutely terrifying and sad. If looking at climate change through a scientific approach isn't enough for deniers I genuinely hope that looking at these consequences through a more humanistic approach is more meaningful. IF there are people who can watch that film and still think that climate change and the things we do to provoke it aren't happening, they are blatantly stupid. 
     <br><br>
On the question from Ken's video introducing this film and the youtube clip, is it companies or consumers furthering this cycle, I think it is easy to say it is a genuine mix of both. Without consumers there would be no companies and without companies there would be no consumers. Measures to stop the waste and pollution of the clothing industry need to be taken by BOTH sides of the people who are causing these major issues.

Since I have previously watched The True Cost, I watched the Patriot Act episode “The Ugly Cost of Fast Fashion.”  In response to Ken’s question about methods of informing the public of issues like this, I definitely think that we can experiment with other ways of disseminating information rather than the traditional full length documentaries that we typically see.  This is because even though those documentaries are informative, really explain the situation, and do a great job at informing the public, other methods, such as with the Patriot Act, are able to offer more.  First of all, they are able to fit information in well without feeling rushed, and they use only a third of the time that a documentary would.  Therefore, if someone doesn’t have much time or doesn’t want to spend a good hour and a half watching a documentary, then they could watch one of these shorter episodes, still being informed of all the important things that a full length documentary would cover.  Second, these episodes can be more relatable and enjoyable to the public.  As used with the Patriot Act, he was able to make people laugh and keep them engaged despite all of the heavy information he was providing and explaining.  It allows people to learn without being bogged down, and they are able to see how the issues impacting the environment are present in their everyday lives.  The main fast fashion company addressed was Zara, which is a big brand that has risen in popularity as they are able to make knockoffs of designer items.  Countless people buy from this company, so through this episode they are able to see how their actions come into play and what the companies they buy from are really like.  It definitely makes the informing of the public more personal.
      <br><br>

Overall, what is important is to inform the public and use the various methods available to us, while also experimenting with other possible ways to allow the public to see the consequences of their actions.  Making people more conscious of what they are doing will make them more receptive to change and working to decrease their environmental impact.

Although I knew most of our clothes in America are produced at an extremely cheap cost in poorer countries around the world, I had no idea of the extent of the corruption. It was heartbreaking to witness the conditions that workers endure in countries such as Bangladesh and Cambodia, just to create clothing that most Americans don’t even need. Inexpensive clothes are not worth the cost of these lives, and yet, we will continue to sit idly and purchase these items. I’m sure there are others, like me, who did not realize the toll that consumption takes on the lives of developing countries, and I hope the Western world will become more aware of the consequences. Unfortunately, I am unsure of whether greater awareness will actually generate action, though, or at least lessen the consumption of this cheap clothing from big corporations.
     <br><br>
 At one point in the film, a news reporter claims that sweatshops should be considered a good thing because they lead to higher wages and better working conditions eventually, as well as physical capital, technology, and human capital. Someone else questioned how sweatshops could possibly be harmful since making clothes was not a dangerous process. I thought these were such ignorant statements, especially after watching the Rana Plaza accident and the protests in Cambodia. It’s easy for someone living in a first world country, who has never experienced anything like this type of work and benefits from their efforts, to say that sweatshops aren’t necessarily terrible. In reality, there is no justification for it, even if the alternative work available is worse than the sweatshops.




</p><hr>


<p>

Watching this film made me think of DiCaprio's film once again, specifically to the scene with the shoes purposefully destroyed by the box cutter. Just like those cheap pairs of shoes, I can't help but imagine how many of those cheap clothing items end up being destroyed by corporations in order to artificially inflate the prices of the current model. When the factory worker in the interview was saying "I don't want more of my people to die for American clothes, we don't want to pay for cheap clothes in blood" all I could think of was NO. It is way worse than that. They are dying for nothing. They died to produce a shoe or a shirt that will go directly to a landfill because there is just too much being produced. 

     <br><br>

Another revelation that shook me was that of the clothing donation issue. I could have never imagined that we have so much excess clothing that even those in extreme poverty don't know what to do with it. We are essentially turning these countries into our 'free' clothing junkyards under the pretense that we are doing them a favor. Like we saw in the Haitian marketplace, that ridiculous amount of clothes will simply end up polluting their environment because there is no way that the enormous mounds of clothing in the outdoors will end up being distributed before it gets ruined under the hot Caribbean sun and frequent tropical showers. This is just another example of how countries less fortunate than ourselves are paying the price for the environmental crisis we have primarily created.

     <br><br>

Lastly, I'm disgusted at the sheer amount of people defending these sweatshops. Like seriously? You love your 10$ t-shirt so much that you are willing to essentially enslave children to make it. You love it so much that you are willing to consciously, at this point, let hundreds of factory workers die for it. So much that you are willing to let an entire generation of foreign brothers suffer, die prematurely and have deformed children because of it?  I'm speechless. Don't even bother with economics, you know, at some point many argued that slavery was economically profitable and presented a better life for African-Americans.

The documentary "The True Cost" shows the horrors of the fashion industry. Fast fashion is damaging to both the  environment and the workers involved. "The True Cost" was very emotional. It was especially heartbreaking learning about the fire that broke out due to factory owners being negligent about the structure of their factory building. Both "The True Cost" and Patriot Act share the same message of fast fashion being bad. However, the films get this message across in different ways. "The True Cost" wants audience members to feel emotionally disturbed so that they will change their ways. Meanwhile, Patriot Act uses comedy to get the message across. I think using different ways to get the environmental message across is important because  everyone is different. What motivates one person to change might be different than what motivates another person. I also think that it's so beautiful seeing people use their different passions, whether that be  comedy, film, dance, sports, science, fashion, etc, to get an environmental message across. You don't have to be limited to being in an environmental science job to help the environment. Rather, every job has the capability to help the environment in some small way!

     <br><br>

In terms of fast fashion, it breaks my heart seeing that brands like ZARA and H&M purposely deceive the public into believing that they are more environmentally friendly than they actually are. A huge change in our values as a culture must take place. Being cool should not have to do with material things, but it should instead have to do with treating the earth and its people with kindness!



</p><hr>


<p>
The film successfully communicates its subject that the cruelty lies behind the glamorous fashion industry where changes are definitely needed. To achieve this, the movie includes some staggering tragedies in Bangladesh and the conflict with blood happened in Cambodia to show viewers what the real lives the garment workers are suffering and how desperate they are. Also, with the interviews with experts, activist and fashion industry workers outside the third world countries, we get a more comprehensive view of what can we do or actually should we do to change the present conditions of the poor workers. This film makes me feel really sad. And also shocked and angry after seeing those bloody altercation and the tragedy of Rana Plaza. We are all human beings who are working our own best to live a more decent life and no one should be treated in that way. Human rights are the most important things and should be put forward as a priority of all time.

I really enjoyed "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" because it kept me captivated. Usually, during an hour long documentary, I began to zone out because of one fact after another. Hasan was able to get the ugly truth about fast fashion across while having everyone's attention. I could show this to my conservative grandpa and he would actually watch it, for the comedy of course. But he would still see and hear the impact of the fast fashion industry. I find myself online shopping at these very stores, sometimes even during Ken’s lectures. During these times, I’m not realizing how much the $30 pants on forever 21 will harm the world around me. I found it shocking that after donating, 87% of the clothes end up in the landfill. This makes me think, what's the point of even driving down to the store and putting it in the donation bin. I have a trashcan within 4 feet that will do the same thing. 
      <br><br>
I was already aware of the poisoned waters and rivers due to watching True Cost last quarter. But, I think Hasan’s ability to quickly compare the negative effects of consuming the water to something humorous was amazing. This made it into something that an average American would think is the worst thing in the world. We are not always reminded about the negative impacts of fashion industries, for example, I had no idea that it is about as bad as an airplane. I always enjoyed finding brands who claim they are organic, not all I will be able to think about is how they are blatantly greenwashing their customers. It is a good thing that thrift shopping and rebuying clothes from others is becoming increasingly popular. I also believe that people should shift away from buying disposable clothes and spend the extra money to have better quality. I never knew that wearing your clothes for 9 months longer can reduce your carbon footprint by 30%. I think this is something that should be on billboards and TV ads. If we would all just sit back and take a look at all the clothes we have gone through in the past year, we might realize how much we waste.

After watching the film “The True Cost”, I still remembered that I was staggering at Rana Plaza Disaster. Hundreds of workers have been buried alive and many families broke up. Even though some workers have pointed out that the building is unsafe and there are cracks in the building, they’ve been forced back with no reason. The reason why the poor workers are dead is rapacious managers of the factories and the brands do not care about working environments and workers but cheap clothes with cheap price. What’s more shocked me is that managers in suit talks sweetshops and poor working conditions like a reward for those poor people living in third world country. Is it right if we treat them bad just because they have no better choice? How ridiculous and how can they say a word like this? Fast Fashion which is the topic word in the film totally renewed the garment industry. Every week, thousands of brands release their new outfits and stimulate customers to consume. These brands are competing with each other with lower price as well. It forces manufacturers to cut corners in order to survive. 
      <br><br>

Also, consumptionism is also the main cause for people to keep buying. Like a quote form the film,“ consumptionism is all about getting people to treat the things they use as the things they use up.” Looking at online YouTubers or bloggers, a significant part of them advertise “goods that are worth to buy” to you and you, as a desire and expectation to own fashion things, keep buying things as these brands and youtubers want. It is a serious problem actually on people who are controlled by their desire. Fast Fashion does stimulate many manufacturers but they produce wastes to environments. 
      <br><br>
Poor working conditions and fast-produced but eliminated quickly fashion are worth for us to give a deep thought to fast fashion industries.

Watching the movie “The True Cost,” made me sick to my stomach. I was horrified to physically see on film the deaths, and the horrible conditions people were being forced to work in. I knew that working conditions were never ideal in foreign countries, but I had no idea just how horrendous they truly were, like so many other people in the world I turned a blind eye to what was sacrificed for me to get affordable clothing. It is so easy for people to ignore the truth behind our clothes, the literal blood that was shed just so we can stay in style, and I hate to say that I contributed to those businesses and occasionally continue to contribute. The fact that these women choose to put themselves through these appalling conditions because they need money and work is not easy to come across for them. The buildings the women work in are crumbling, the chemicals used on the clothing are cancerous, they essentially get paid nothing, and after a full day’s work they get zero say in anything. If they speak out they’re punished and beaten because they can…In the film one of the workers spoke out and said that their hard work is under appreciated and gone unseen because people around the world don’t do anything to help fix their conditions. In the documentary they show the conditions that they work in and the conditions that they live in, they show how these people are not making nearly enough to live a decent life. If those of us who are privileged enough to have a voice all spoke up and stood up to these huge clothing corporations then we could actually get changes for these women.

The film "The True Cost" also struck me in a similar way.  So much of this class so far has been focused mainly on the environmental effects of climate change relating to our consumer culture.  The disasters that will result in unimaginable amounts of human suffering, although frighteningly close, still seemed not quite here yet.  The movie however brought it very close to home.  Right now, as I type this, there are millions of incredibly impoverished people working in god awful conditions on below livable wages just to make  clothes that will quickly be sent to a dump.  Yet people everywhere continue to buy into the idea that they need to continuously buy excessive amounts of cheap clothing to be happy and fit into society.  What disgusted me a lot as well was the scene where the high ranking H&M woman basically denied that they were at all part of the problem, trying to shy away from the (correct) accusation that the workers they practically forced into garment labor were not being payed a livable wage.  It's crazy to think about, that the clothes I am wearing right now were likely made in a foreign country by someone 10x as poor as me working in conditions that would give them and their children deadly illnesses.  If these factories were situated in the U.S. and the workers in them were our own people, would we not be outraged by it and stop buying the clothes produced from their exploitation?  But because the suffering is happening overseas out of sight and out of mind we are perfectly comfortable to justify supporting the new trends a huge brand rolls out each week.  I just wonder when people realize that fashion is entirely a luxury good, not needed at all for their life or happiness,  and start buying well made clothes that last and aren't produced from blood labor.

I found the statistics quoted by the factory employee to be eye opening. I had no idea that the cost of garments had gone down relative to inflation. I found the Rana plaza crisis to be horrifying. I see it as one of the new evils of late stage capitalism. Learning that the size of the clothing industry was 3 Trillion dollars was kind of astonishing. This movie also reminded about how evil Monsanto is. Another thing I learned was that clothing is non biodegradable, I assumed that since most clothing originally comes from cotton that it will biodegrade. It is interesting to see another evil perpetrated by our dependence on cotton. I liked the quote near the end, “Money is a means.” Absolutely money is just a means, and not the be all end all. We should keep that in mind.

I agree with you here. I obviously knew that sweatshops exist and have existed for a long time, I knew that fast fashion was environmentally destructive, and I knew that the fashion industry made a lot of money--I just never realized how much. I never realized how evil and dangerous sweatshops are, how environmentally destructive the fast fashion industry is, and how much money the fashion industry made. When trying to become more eco-friendly, I became vegetarians (with plans to transition into a completely vegan lifestyle), but I didn't really consider the amount of change I could make in my closet. 
      <br><br>
Additionally, even though it seems obvious, I never really linked the agricultural and fashion industry. Pesticides used to make the cotton (or wool, linen, and other natural material in clothes) destroy the people who work the field and live near the fields (from giving people brain tumors to giving children developmental, physical, and mental disabilities) AND destroy the environment that we all share--something that has additional health detriments to people. A lot of people know that Monsanto is an evil corporation and a lot of people (especially here in California) try to eat vegan food, but I never considered that the kind of clothing I buy helps Monsanto and contributes to the pesticide problem we have in the world. I think talking about the link between the fashion and agriculture industries was really powerful and helped us make better choices--and to demand action more efficiently and effectively. 
      <br><br>
I was also surprised to learn that clothes aren't biodegradable, although I am not surprised considering that lots of clothes have plastic and other synthetic fibers in them and the amount of chemicals that go into our clothes make any natural material extremely unnatural. This presents a double evil here. Natural material in clothing is grown using too many toxic chemicals and pesticides that have deep environmental and health consequences. But not natural materials are made out of plastic, which is not only polluting to the environment, but is also made out of fossil fuels, which further perpetuates that problem.

The episode “The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion” on the Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj examined how fast fashion brands like Zara and H&M put out clothes every week, making Americans shop more than ever before, and how this unsustainable lifestyle is destroying our planet. Firstly, I would like to say that, while I agree that documentaries are effective, this video was probably one of the most engaging videos I have seen about this topic. Utilizing comedy to talk about serious issues is, in my opinion, incredibly effective considering how everyday people will watch these videos and will probably take more from it than they would a documentary. I, for one, am now inclined to watch the rest of his videos on Netflix, considering how appealing they were.
      <br><br>

One of the things that stood out to me was that in 2015, textile production created more greenhouse gases than international flights and maritime shipping combined. The episode went on to play a video where a woman explained that growing cotton to make a jacket would have taken 10,330 liters of water, which is 24 years of drinking water for one person. Like she said, this is absolutely wild. I think that it’s clear that Americans have no idea how much of an impact our bad shopping habits have on the environment. I’m happy that thrift shopping has become such a trend and that people are seeing buying second hand clothes because they are seeing it as cool. I know a lot of people on Instagram who showcase their thrifted clothes and they get a lot of likes for it.
      <br><br>

After watching the episode, I was curious to see what people thought about it so I looked at the comments on the video. The top comment was how an American throws away clothes after using them a few times while an Indian uses clothes for a longer period of time, then wears it at night, then uses it as Holi wear, then uses it as a cloth to clean the table, and then as a rug to clean the floor. This was interesting to me because I know how Americans like to have things for every need that they have and would rather actually purchase a rug, for example, then reuse something like clothes to clean whatever they need to instead. Because Americans live such materialistic lives, the idea of reusing an item for something that it might not be exactly meant for is foreign to us. I think that it’s very important that this mindset changes, and changes fast.

I also watched the short video “The Ugly Truth of Fast fashion” with Hasan Minhaj and agree that it was one of the most engaging videos I have watched regarding the issue of fast fashion. This video was entertaining but also very informative which intrigued me to keep watching. Hasan Minhaj utilized humor to talk about the serious issues revolving around fast fashion companies and how these companies are quickly destroying our planet. I think Minhaj’s approach to addressing these issues helps branch out to a wider audience who wouldn’t normally watch a documentary about fast fashion. There were many things that stood out to me in this documentary including all the statistics that were stated throughout the video. One of these statistics being that originally in 1980 we would buy on average 12 articles of clothing a year. Now we buy an average of 68 pieces of clothing a year. This goes to show how our culture of consumption has changed dramatically. The emergence of fast fashion had a large effect on our increasing consumption. Fast fashion companies are able to quickly make cheap clothing that reflects high brand fashion lines. These fast fashion companies include Topshop, H&M, Zara, Fashion nova, etc. These companies are able to make copy trends they see and start selling them within 24 hours. TI was shocked to hear this because I didn’t know companies could copy trends this quickly. A specific example to this quick response to manufacturing is when Fashion Nova started selling an exact replica of a high brand dress Kim Kardashian wore within one day. This technique along with dynamic assortment (allows companies to pump out new clothing every week) makes fast fashion possible. While the manufacturing of clothes is dangerous, the consumption is no better. An average American throws away around 80 pounds of clothing every year. Something else that shocked me was the fact about donating clothes. Most of the clothes we donate are thrown away. One salvation army creates 18 tons of unwanted clothes every three days. If these clothes aren’t sold in a month, the scraps are sold to developing worlds. Something that made me angry in this video was learning that fast fashion companies fake being eco friendly. This is commonly known as greenwashing. Many of the claims that companies make about going green are a scam. This allows people to think it is okay to keep consuming more clothes when it is actually just destroying our planet even more. Overall, we need to fix this issue. I never realized how bad the fast fashion industry was until watching this video, and never realized how simple it is to make quick changes. If we were to wear clothes fir nine months longer or even bought something used instead if new, it could potentially save nearly 6 pounds of Co2 emissions which is equivalent to removing half a million cars off the road for a year. This simple change can go a long way clearly. If everyone were to do this, we could easily help save the planet and stop fast fashion.

My response to the film, “The True Cost” was primarily emotional. I asked myself “What have I done to contribute to the reality of the fashion industry?”. I was so sad to learn how shopping online and in person have negatively affected the lives of those in third world countries. Hearing about the unfortunate building collapse and how the garment workers warned those in higher power about the terrible conditions of the building, yet they did nothing but force them to go back and work made my heart sink. It made me think about what we really value here in America and it seems that we really only care about what benefits us. It was illuminated when the woman being interviewed said she sees nothing wrong with how the garment workers are being pushed by the fashion industry to produce clothes at such a fast pace and get paid two dollars a day. We are generating an excess amount of clothing at such a low cost, but at what cost? Thousands of lives, that could have been prevented, have been lost; It is time for change… we really need to wake up and see what is happening to our people. 
      <br><br>
One quote that stuck with me is that ”fashion cannot be thought of as a disposable product”. I don’t know why I never asked myself what happens with clothes once you throw them away or donate them, but now I know. Even when donating clothes, not all of them are bought from thrift stores, most are sent over to third world countries where they are also left in a tough situation not knowing what to do with excess clothing. After watching it, I honestly felt pessimistic. It is hard to look at a worldwide problem and come up with one solution to fix the whole damage. But, I am confident learning about the reality of the fashion industry will motivate us to make a change and stop consuming at such a fast rate.

  I also experienced an emotional response when watching the film, to see the dead bodies and mourning families in Bangladesh and Cambodia was a heart-wrenching experience. Something that truly shocked me was the sheer lack of concern people have for one another as human beings. When the workers in Rana Plaza told their management that they saw cracks in the building and felt that it was going to fall apart, they were ignored and forced to return to work. What makes matters even worse is that after such a horrible tragedy, events like this continue to happen. In places like Cambodia, where workers protested for $160 a month (only around $5 a day), they were met with gunfire and beatings in the streets by riot control police. Something I found particularly disgusting was when a western executive was asked about whether or not they cared about the conditions people worked in to make close, she simply replied by saying that there are worse jobs in the world, and at least the fashion industry is employing them. How can someone have so little disregard for another human’s quality of life? 
      <br><br>
It seems to me that the fashion industry considers not only its products to be disposable, but its employees as well. This film truly made me realize that if we want to act on climate change, we cannot just rely on science and technology, but we have to implement real societal change. Even if we just began to implement more ethical practices in our labor laws, I think this could have a cascading effect of concern for the quality of the products, and in turn the reduction of consumption by the developed world.
<br><hr>

This film was incredibly emotional and I also asked myself the same thing, "What have I done to contribute to the reality of the fashion industry?”. Watching the families crying for the deaths of their loved ones and holding up pictures of them in hopes to find them, hearing how when they attempted to get better working conditions and wages they were beaten, seeing the people of Cambodia riot for a minimum wage of 160 dollars per month and in return they received not only beatings but were also killed was incredibly heartbreaking but also incredibly frustrating that this is occurring because of fast fashion.
      <br><br>
From watching this film I did not realize that most of donated clothes did not make it to thrift stores but instead went to third world countries in huge amounts to the point that local business there was ruined and there is such a large amount of it. The production of clothing not only is horrible to the workers in these factories but incredibly harmful for the environment because we now use genetically modified cotton to make these items which uses harmful pesticides which may have caused multiple deaths as well, while also  contaminating the soil, but also making leather shoes and other items also contaminate the water supplies.
      <br><br>
Seeing how millions of people treasure their clothing because its a way of expressing themselves, which I do understand, but it does make me less hopeful that these conditions can stop. Hopefully more people can be educated and buy from places where they treat their workers better because I do believe that consumers have some power over corporations.

I watched “The True Cost,” and since then I have sifted through my closet, looking at all of the articles of clothing I own. Last year, I made a conscious decision to stop shopping from “fast fashion” brands such as Forever 21 and Fashion Nova. However, I continued to shop at H&M because throughout the store, they conveyed propagandas of being environmentally friendly. Some of their clothing may be made of recycled textiles, but I shamefully forgot to think of the conditions that the factory workers endure just for me to have a simple top. Watching the pain in the factory workers’ families when they realized their loved ones were gone in the collapsed building made me tear up. The clothing on my back has caused an immense amount of trauma to hundreds of thousands of families around the world. I haven’t even worn some of the clothing on my hangers, yet I still continue to look for more additions to my wardrobe. This film made me realize that I need to research a company’s environmental and human ethics before supporting their corporation, and of course, continue to shop second-hand. 
      <br><br>


The point that really hit home for me was when they started showing clips of young Youtubers who were doing a “clothing haul” for their audience. As a teenager, I actually watched one of the girls portrayed showing her clothing that she just purchased, and I immediately recognized her. Bethany Mota, the girl who ended the montage with, “I need to stop,” is a Youtuber that I used to look up to. I realized that throughout the years of watching her, and countless other Youtubers, I was “brainwashed” into wanting to consume just as much as they did. I wanted to show “hauls” just as I had watched them do, and I thought that every new piece of clothing would bring me joy and happiness. I thought that buying clothes would make me feel as ecstatic as they seemed in their videos. Furthermore, I thought that I would feel as “cool” as these influencers. This ties into Ken’s point about how advertisers target people by having influencers promote advertisements towards their following. I am guilty of following multiple influencers on Instagram and Twitter, and I’m constantly checking out the clothing and makeup advertisements that pop up on my social media. Honestly, the marketing strategies that they employ are highly effective because I always fall into the trap of seeing something on someone with a large following, and purchasing it, thinking that it will elevate my life. This effect is horrific, but impressive because of how they’ve managed to sway so many people to give into consumerism. 
      <br><br>


I think the best way to spread the message is to have the same influencers that advertise for fast fashion to use their platform to discuss the environmental and human impacts. If they were paid to oppose fast fashion instead of promoting it, young people would be persuaded to follow their footsteps because they look up to these “popular” figures. Since these influencers are able to prompt a mass amount of people to buy things, I think if we reversed the message, more people would be willing to resist fast fashion and be more eco-conscious.

Wow I just have to say I give major props to Valerie. I feel awful because I know now the costs on others of fast fashion but I still have bought fast fashion clothing. So I think that this is a wake up call, I need to be more like Valerie. I think that it is crazy how many pieces of clothing are just wasted every year and I think that it should be recycled and not wasted. I can not believe that 342 million gallons of oil are used for fast fashion and then some of that is dumped into the river.  

      <br><br>

I wish that we also would not follow trend setters but rather just stay content with the clothes we have. We should be using our clothes until they are unwearable. I think that popular figures are just stuck in a bubble because they are getting paid millions for doing promotions and they do not even for a second stop and think about the effect on the environment.


<br><hr>

Suffice to say that “The True Cost” was a documentary that really exposed a whole other side of the fashion industry and what lays behind the glitz and glam that we are usually presented with. Even before becoming environmentally conscious, I never really shopped at “fast fashion” brands purely out of aesthetic and stylistic preference. Actually, I’ve never cared much about following the fashion trends dictated by brands or companies because I adamantly believe that if I’m going to put an effort into my outer appearance, it’s going to be in order to express a facet of my self-identity. Fashion and the beauty industry should be about every individual’s personal choices, preferences, and what makes them feel most comfortable in their own skin. 
      <br><br>


Furthermore, I really believe that clothing is something that can easily be recycled. Either you pass down the clothes you no longer want to wear or keep to friends, relatives, or you can donate it. Of course, you can also choose to keep items that you like even if they the trendsetting magazines and corporations say they are outdated because fashion trends follow a cycle and what’s been deemed out of fashion always comes back in fashion at some point. I believe that both of these ways can help reduce the amount of new clothes we buy. 
      <br><br>


This documentary really hit me hard when it showed the hardship and danger that the factory workers and their families endure for the clothes that we take for granted. Since buying clothes, food, electronics, etc. are so easy for us — essentially we just have to walk in  a store, choose what we want, and pay — most of the time we forget to even consider how the items we’re consuming were produced. If we kept this in consideration, it would make us more responsible consumers who are able to hold big corporations accountable and ensure that those who put their blood, sweat, and tears into making those products we carelessly consume and quickly discard are treated with the respect and dignity they deserve. Most of all, no one’s life should be put into danger or lost simply to make our clothes. As a takeaway message, we need to be more aware and boycott corporations who don’t meet basic ethical or environmental standards because it’s really not too much to ask or expect since we — the consumers — earn them so much money. 
      <br><br>


Also, I firmly agree with you. I think the beauty community on youtube is also responsible for propagating this culture of rapid consumerism and materialism when it comes to fashion and cosmetics. Youtubers like Bethany Mota are also consumers but at the same time when they earn enough of a following, corporations give them money and use them to further their own agenda. I don’t blame the Youtubers but I think viewers can kindly remind them to be more conscious of the message they are sending with their behavior in videos and the larger ramifications it can have on a personal level and environmentally. Fashion should never be at the expense of people’s lives or the environment.


<br><hr>

I particularly agree that the people that help to promote these fast fashion brands need to understand the impact that they are contributing to climate change. I think that the idea of making profit for essentially committing an environmental crime is baffling. We, as a society, need to allow the companies and special interest groups that combat climate change to help and fund influencers - the same influencers that continue to harm our planet.
      <br><br>


When I think about this strategy however, I can’t help but notice what makes our world turn - money. It is money that influences everything - including the well-being of our climate. The fact that we need influencers in order to improve our Earth’s situation rather than just have the general understanding that we need to make a change is really saddening to me. We need to do a better job of looking at our own personal lives, and realizing and reflecting on what we are personally doing to our planet. We need people to tell us our mistakes rather than figuring them out on their own.

      <br><br>

The use of money should not make sure that our planet is not dying. We should not need to pay other people to tell us what to do because we look up to them or they have large sphere of influence over our lives. But, if we need to, the money needs to be matched by the large corporations that are continuously profiting off of these items. People need to come together more than ever in order to combat climate change and make sure that we are doing our best to fight the Zara’s and H&M’s of the world. Only with that can we really start to fight against climate change and consumerism.

The documentary “The True Cost” was effective at communicating its subject that people nowadays have to be aware of the consequences of “fast fashion”. It applied real events, narratives, and interviews from people of different backgrounds to convey its message and idea globally. When I was watching the news reported Rana Plaza disaster, I felt irritated toward the company, which only cared about its own profit but ignored the poor and dangerous labor condition faced by vulnerable workers. I was also shocked by how materialistic our society has become that people even tried to achieve the things that they wanted at the cost of life and environment. 
      <br><br>

What’s more, it is incredible to learn that fashion today is the number two most polluting industry on earth. There is so much work behind producing clothes and so much of chemicals has been released to harm human bodies and create staggering environmental impacts. This documentary did change my attitudes that I should consider more carefully whether I need this clothes or not before buying it in order to avoid wasting. Seeing people who are trying to change the fashion system, like People Tree, at the end of the movie, makes me feel optimistic. I also believe that more and more people would become aware of this issue in the future and would join the movement to make a big change.

I really agree with your comment. I also thought the film was highly effective in presenting and delving into the crisis of what is fast fashion. I also agree that it was done in a very powerful way by being so many different examples from across the world to show all the perspectives of people affected by this epidemic. It was truly horrifying to watch the scene after the collapse of the garment factory. I couldn’t believe that 1,000 lives were lost because of the skewed perspectives of the management and our society. The living wages, safety, and humanity of these workers is never considered as they are simply focused on production and money. The worst part of this, is that what they are being severely underpaid to work on isn't even benefiting their culture. Us, in the west, are the ones setting these demands and making the conditions get like this. We keep demanding more product and cheaper prices and they are forced to cut corners to stay in business and stay competitive. It is a vicious cycle of corruption. 
      <br><br>
It is so sad to me that ⅙ people work somehow in the fashion industry. Yes, I do enjoy fashion and I think it is a fun form of expression and culture, but quite honestly it is depressing that it has become such a force. I wonder what would happen if ⅙ of our population were working in the environmental sustainability field. Clothes are such a trivial thing for people to be dying over. We are killing our earth and its inhabitants for clothing. This is so terribly backward. I was so saddened by the section where the woman working in one of the factories described being beat up for asking for better working conditions and fair pay. People are suffering for the newest trends that Americans obsess over. 
      <br><br>
I also thought a very thought-provoking part of this film was the description of how this rise of fast fashion happened. As it has been present all of my lifetime, I didn't realize that this is still a very new phenomena. It was so interesting how the dissolve of the middle class went along with all of this. How all the things people really needed in life like insurance and housing were becoming very pricey and unaffordable while clothing prices were plummeting, putting emphasis on this industry.

<p>
In the film “The True Cost,” my eyes were completely opened to the destructive nature, both socially and economically, but also environmentally of the fashion industry in today’s world. From making the production cheaper of clothing, to outsourcing its production to increase profits, the industry is now more wasteful than ever as the growing fast fashion dominates the scene. It was disturbing to learn about the labor conditions that many of the “sweatshop” workers were in and to learn what happened in the Rana Plaza Disaster where an eight-story building collapsed in Bangladesh and hundreds (over 900) were found dead as factory owners ignored the order to evacuate the building. In this nightmare, workers had tried to point out the cracks in the building and tried to explain they needed to evacuate but were forced to go back to work by the heads of the factory, directly resulting in their deaths.
      <br><br>
The theme of this prioritization of profit over human lives in the film continues as the part that stood out to me the most was in relation to the pesticides being sprayed in India and the effects that it has been having in the local area. In this area in India, pesticides are being sprayed over and over again and are having detrimental health effects on the farmers that have to use them as the rates of mental retardation and physical disabilities have risen significantly since they began spraying the chemicals. One of the women who was interviewed during the film explained how the use of pesticides worked as the companies who own the chemicals also produce medicine to address certain illnesses that may come from the spraying of pesticides. Once you start spraying pesticides, you have to continue the practice as they degrade the soil and make it so that the plants are increasingly reliable on the chemicals, In addition, if farmers develop diseases from the pesticides, companies like Monsanto are right there to sell you drugs so either way you spin it, Monsanto makes a profit while the environment and the people who farm the land loose. In addition to what was going on in India, a similar story was shown in Texas as cotton is increasingly being grown as a genetically modified crop that has been engineered to work with pesticides. This directly relates to Monsanto and other companies initiatives to going control over the industry and set aside the problems of degrading the environment through the process. The film then went back to describing the detrimental effect of consumer culture which on top of what I have discussed so far, has lead to extreme amounts of waste that is unprecedented in scale.

The message within "The Ugly Truth Of Fast Fashion" centered on fashion being an environmentally destructive part of our lifestyle. And while we don't have to fully give up that part, we should just reevaluate how often and for how long our clothing is used for. Personally, the most interesting moment in the video came from the section on "greenwashing." He compared the misleading advertising of eco-friendliness by brands and the like to the wording of the Constitution. It's something that I've questioned in the past, but never really looked into. The ambiguity used by advertisers from major brands on their green initiatives cause the buyer to believe that the product is better for the environment, even though it still has major ramifications on our world. Hasan Minhaj hit a tone that I greatly resonated with in questioning what exactly green, eco-friendly, or environmentally responsible mean. There isn't exactly a governmental guideline for those terms. It's similar to how the term, "organic," is perceived. Generally, organic food is associated with healthiness. When truthfully, that organic label really only describes the production process, such as there not being chemical additives, and the like. The consumerism centered lifestyle has been rapidly growing, with celebrities like Kylie Jenner becoming a billionaire because of it. It shows no sign of stopping. However, if the world is to survive, I believe that the government and major world leaders have to regulate the use of the environment for producing products. It has gone on far too long. There is no reason why the fashion industry should be allowed to tear down "33% of ancient or threatened forests" for what, cheap pants? 


      <br><br>

Overall, I enjoyed watching the Patriot Act episode. I appreciated how Hasan delivered a truly important message of less wasteful use, while also informing the public in a humorous matter. I will definitely watch other episodes because of it.

It is ridiculous on how fast we have been putting more and more harm on the environment we are living in and still nothing seems to be stopped and everything is going on. Factories are producing more products and as consumers we are buying more stuff. It is time for everyone of us to look at the pattern of our consumption. The fast industries are helping people own the factories to make more money and they claim their products to be good and environmentally friendly just want to get people to buy it. And as consumers, we are also tricked by different types of advertisements that tell us to buy stuff.
      <br><br>

It is also not about polluting our environment by producing countless products and throwing them away when we don’t use it. Look at those underdeveloped countries where people work in dangerous and unhealthy environments and facing different violence while still can’t earn enough money. We are just a little bit fortunate than them but we don’t see the problem behinds it and didn’t realize how ugly that fact is behind the fast industries. It is the world we are living, we are not just here that need to maintain a fair and comfortable place for everyone to live, but a sustainable place for our future generation to live as well.

<p>
In response to Ken's first question regarding who is to blame for the rise of consumerism and fast fashion, I believe that we, the consumers, are mostly at fault. I was convinced of this belief during my watching of the "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion,"  as several points they made really stood out to me. For example, they stated in the episode that the average American now buys an average of 68 new pieces of clothing a year. While the cheap price of clothing sold by fast fashion retailers is partially to blame for such a high figure, we are giving them the demand to continue producing such waste by providing high demand and a consistent market for their products. In addition, the episode featured a section regarding our need to have constant new outfits to show off on social media, even sharing that compared to 20 years ago, we are only keeping garments on average half as long. This need to always be changing the clothing we own is very much on the consumer as well, as they are the ones who principally decide how long to keep their clothing.


      <br><br>


Second, I felt that "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" was a great format to share this important message of our addiction to fast fashion, because it was concise and very pleasurable to watch. Not once did I find myself wanting to turn it off, and I felt that the comedy of it actually increased the effectiveness of it's message because the jokes made some of the episode's main points much more memorable and impactful. In addition to this shorter, comedic approach, I think that a brand that focuses on producing higher-quality, more sustainable clothing working with a major social influencer could be very effective. For example, if a brand were to work with an influencer such as Kylie Jenner, someone who Ken mentioned as creating this fast fashion mindset, and showed her wearing their same garments over and over again online, it may be able to convince some of her followers that they should buy clothing from more sustainable sources, and that they don't need to constantly be rotating their closets all the time.

The subject of this film is fashion industry, especially fast fashion industry. This film perfectly and effectively communicates it subject. It describes the whole industry that influences laborers and environment. In the form of narrative and interviews, the real response to the impact of the fast fashion industry. I think everyone can be the audience of this film, because buying clothes is a casual normal thing that every single person does. Casual viewers also should know the behind process of making clothes. My reaction is more emotional. I feel pity and empathy to some workers and farmers in developing countries who are at the bottom of cycle of making clothes. They work in terrible environment, like sweatshop, bear the safety question, get least wage, but with no choice. Also, the poor countries are not getting richer because of their abundant labor force. As a result, the use of pesticides for the production of clothing raw materials, like cotton, and clothing factories that emit unregulated prison and harmful substances cause the environment to become more and more deteriorated. The worse environment causes health problem. However, local poor citizen cannot afford high treatment. For the first time, I learned about the serious consequences behind a production industry. Before, I think this kind of thing is none of my business. But now I think more people and public should pay attention to this and improve this pathological cycle. After watching it, I feel little pessimistic. This film profoundly reveals the cruelty of some glamorous industries that we usually don’t pay attention. We can just focus on buy buy buy. I am willing to recommend this film to my friends.

Just as you think that the world couldn’t be crazier, Hasan’s powerful speech on the cold hard truth of the fashion industry opens your eyes.
      <br><br>

My experience with clothes has been pretty stable throughout my life. When I was a kid, I wouldn’t even bother going shopping for clothes, my mom would buy me t-shirts that she thought were nice. By 7th grade, I would start buying bunches of clothes from GAP, and each shopping would last me about a year. This tradition has been the same for the past 7 years.
      <br><br>

I wouldn’t consider myself a follower of the fast fashion trend, since my yearly purchase is at most 12 to 15 pieces of clothing, and I am particularly proud of my way of disposing my old clothes. Instead of throwing them away or donating them, I would gift them to my younger cousins.
      <br><br>

I think we all play a role in this fast fashion industry. Being able to fill up your wardrobe is a pretty badass thing to achieve. The feeling of owning things gratifies us. Getting people to know that this is not that big of a deal is important. We don’t actually need 20 different t-shirts, three will do, you rotate them throughout the summer season, I bet few of your friends will notice it.

I was shocked and appalled at the violent incident between workers and managers described by garment worker Shima Akhter in The True Cost. Living in the wealthy western world affords many of us a certain degree of ignorance concerning the intricacies of the systems that make up the fashion industry. We think this kind of violent union suppression is a thing of the past, but it isn't so in places like Dhaka. It's really disconcerting to then hear certain people defending these kind of harmful working conditions. On another level, the patenting of genetically modified crops by companies like Monsanto has chilling implications, and not just concerning the fashion industry. Given enough time and lack of supervision, companies like this will one day own the entirety of the world's agriculture supply by making the environment inhospitable to any unmodified crops. Since those companies own the seeds people will be forced to buy from them without even the option of legally reproducing the plant themselves. The poor will be indebted to these companies indefinitely. 
      <br><br>


The coldly calculating attitude from profit-minded groups and individuals taken toward those with no choice but to take what little they are given is horrifying. Documentaries like The True Cost should be seen by more people in our consumption-based society; unfortunately most people will only become aware of them in classes like this because they are not advertised by people hoping to profit off of them.

Just as I thought that the ugly truth of fashion couldnt get uglier Hasan Minhaj proved me wrong. I knew about fast fashion knocking off high brands. I have witnessed itmyself and even bought the clothing myself. It is stylish and cheap, which is what people want. Especially if it is an outfit similar to one worn by a celebrity. Let's be honest most of us are poor and can not afford to pay the price of the clothng. Yet that does notstop us from wanting to look expensive and feeling good. Yet after watching this type of content you do not feel as good to see the price others pay is far greater. We are realing screwing with these developing countries. It isnot enough that we are abusing their work ethic, poisoning their rivers and making their children ill, that we still have the audacity to dump the clothing we no longer want in their land. We are shitty human beings.

It’s a “lose, lose, lose for the people and the land” as the woman from India states that the companies have control over pretty much everything. The amount of chicken they are causing is evil. I wanted to cry when I saw the young boy in the village struggling to walk with his walker and when I heard that there may be as many as 60 children with mental retardation in any given village. There have been 250,000 recorded Indian farmer suicides. This is becoming a mental health issue.
      <br><br>

 This is a nightmare. If we are buying shirts for $20 couldn’t they afford to give the factory owners more than $0.30 that way they could pay their workers fairly? We ought to start a petition on change.org or invoke action in some way. No human should have to live the way they do in Bangladesh or other sweatshops in developing countries. I like that they quoted Martin Luther King Jr. in the documentary because they hit hard on the idea that no human life is worth more than another’s. We have to change the way our society thinks about cheap labor if we want to make any change in the fast fashion industry.
      <br><br>

“There are things you use and there are things that you use up.” The fashion industry has conditioned us to treat all of our items as disposable. Once we have worn something a lot we feel like it is old or outdated. Where does this mentality come from? We used to wear things for their utility and I remember my grandpa saying you wore your clothes till they fell apart. Today the propaganda of fashion icons try to make us feel the need to stay up to date on trends and buy things for how they make us feel rather than their utility. I cant believe how many clothes get sent to haiti after people don’t buy them in thrift shops. All the clothes I bought last year were from thrift shops. I used to donate all of my old clothes and I thought that they were getting put to good use. It’s unfortunate to know that even in our best intentions things still go to waste in this society at the expense of our environment.

This really upset me too, especially because for women the fashion industry engineers trends to come and go, and with social media the turn around of trends is even faster. I agree that it’s painful to watch as communities are broken because of the interests of big corporations which at the end of the day are there to serve the needs of the buyers. I think the greatest issue is that people are so focused on what the “next big thing is”and are basically programmed to get bored with the old and excited when the new is presented to them. 

      <br><br>

I think an interesting study would be to give as much information on each product. Maybe put where its made, who it is made by, how much they are getting paid, and the impact of the production of clothing on the people who are making them. I don’t think people are choosing to buy clothing that is negatively affecting people, I think a lot of the choices are just made because people are ignorant. If given all the information, maybe people would choose differently.

The most striking part of the film to me was when the fashion influencers were showing off their shopping "hauls" on youtube. Apart from making me visibly cringe, this portion of the film perfectly encapsulated what is wrong with current consumer culture in the US and abroad. This attitude of compulsively buying for want instead of for need enables the fashion industry to continue their destructive practices.  I agree with the fashion designer from the film who said it is up to the consumer to change the practices of producers. Imagine if millions and millions of people who currently support fast fashion only went clothes shopping two or three times a year, this would have a drastic impact on the industry over a period of time.  I am reminded of the phrase "there's no such thing as free lunch", meaning every good (even if it's free) has impacted someone to get onto your plate or into your closet.
      <br><br>

On a personal level, the film was striking to watch. As someone who grew up in a household where unnecessary waste of any kind was heavily discouraged, I can't fathom buying a garment, wearing it once or twice, and throwing it out. I almost take pride in wearing a piece of clothing until it absolutely can't be worn anymore. Not to sound holier than thou, but I don't support fast fashion and despise clothes shopping. I think it is a waste of time and their are more important things you can do with your time, money, and energy. I just hope my fellow students change their practices after watching the film. As someone said in the film, a "revolution of values" is needed in America. We need to turn inward and realize what is truly important in life, and that it certainly isn't that $8.50 skirt from H&M.

I agree with much of what you had to say about compulsive buying and the responsibilities of consumers. As you stated, there is such a strong focus on buying for wants rather than needs. Because of the human tendency to never stop desiring for more, people will buy cheap clothing in excessive quantities in order to keep up with ever-changing trends and their increasing and never-ending desires. While watching the film, I was reminded of the famous story of the Buddha, in which Siddartha goes on a journey to seek what is described as Enlightenment. This concept meant different things for different figures along his journey, but for Siddartha, one of the key concepts of Enlightenment was characterized by the idea that in order to end suffering, one must rid themselves of desire. While he does end up accomplishing this (among other things that help him to achieve Nirvana), this is not feasible for the average consumer given the fact that the average consumer is not the Buddha. However, he did have a point in that the root of suffering, simply put, comes from the human tendency to want. While this sounds quite elementary, this concept is truly the root of all conflict in human history. As I already relayed, it is not possible to extinguish ourselves of human instinct to seek “more;”  however, it is possible to have a higher awareness about what we purchase and how we contribute to consumerism. As you mentioned and as was described in the film, it is up to consumers to change their habits and in turn change the actions of producers.


<br><hr>
I certainly agree with the comment above, the fact that the most irritating part of the film was when the fashion influencers were showing their “hauls,” from shopping on Youtube. The film, “The True Cost,” explores how fashion has a definite influence on people and the planet. When the clips were presented with the youtube hauls was just evidence on the problem with the consumer culture. In the clips, the influencers were constantly saying phrases such as, “I do not really need this..” Or “I just had to buy it.” These phrases reflect on the attitudes most Americans in our society have today when it comes to shopping. Sadly, our society is so oblivious to the suffering that third world countries encounter due to the massive growth of the fashion industry. These countries encounter hazardous working conditions and thus results in horrible tragedies such as a massive rise in birth defects and cancer due to the abundance of harmful chemicals from pesticide infused cotton they deal with. These workers unfortunately have no choice but to work in this fashion industry because the are trying to just make a living and its heartbreaking thinking about how this may in turn be very harmful to them in the end. This shows that these workers are willing to risk their health conditions in turn for making a living.

I will admit that when shopping I do sometimes buy things I do not need and do not think of the harmful effects of American consumerism. It is unfortunate that many Americans do not think of consumerism as a bad thing and do not think about where these clothes come from when buying them as well as the hard work that was put into making them. I think if people start to realize this then they will try to take good care and use their items and or clothing until it can no longer be physically worn or used.

I believe both parties are responsible for our current problem with fast fashion. Big corporations are actively exploiting workers to make cheap, disposable garments that we will inevitably throw away, as we contribute to the vast amounts of clothing waste already present in landfills. But we, as consumers, are buying into it. The True Cost really opened my eyes as to just how bad the fashion industry really is. I've known that clothes sold by big, affordable brands such as Forever 21 and H&M were not meant to last, but I had no idea the impact that these clothes had. I looked at my closet while watching the documentary and felt my stomach turn; a lot of what was in there was bought from companies such as these because they are cheap and affordable. To know that I've been unknowingly contributing to the deaths of underpaid, unrepresented workers horrified me. I had no idea just how bad it really was. I feel awful. 

      <br><br>

The toll environmentally, as well as socially, is not worth a $5 shirt to me. I think it's urgently important for people to stop buying into these clothing brands and fueling their mistreatment. The agricultural side of this, in and of itself, was horrifying. I'm definitely going to look into where my clothes come from, and I am going to stop feeding into these huge corporations. I already mostly buy my clothes from thrift stores, whether online, like through Depop, or in person, but I feel like it is so urgent for everyone to make the switch.

      <br><br>

The videos of people being trapped by collapsed buildings that were known to be unsafe, or of the protests for workers rights that ended in gunfire are horrifying to watch. People deserve human rights, and to be paid equally for their work. I feel like the only way to change this is to buy into sustainably sourced companies in order to make them grow and be able to employ more people ethically. As a woman in the video said "I do not want people to wear clothes that are made from our blood." When did Americans become so self-centered that they care more about clothing than actual, human lives? The Fox News interview at the beginning really pissed me off, too. "Sweatshops are helping" is an awful statement. People are dying, and the spread of misinformation such as this is only going to delay change. Funny how it was on Fox News, the same people who deny climate change....

One word came to mind after watching both the documentary and Ken's lecture: appalled. Watching the conditions the garment workers faced as they suffered to create fast fashion for the money hungry industry was hard and made me extremely angry and the lack of respect they receive. Majority being women, these workers are treated with utter disrespect and expected to produce more product for wages that are not even life sustaining. Watching the impact of the factory building that collapsed and crushed over 1000 garment worker broke my heart as day after day another death occurred within this fashion industry due to cutting corners. The most labor intensive industry fashion not only is harming the safety of these workers, it is also harming their health as pesticides, GMOs and chemicals are being used at rapid rates and are becoming lethal to those surrounded by it. Hearing the Organic Cotton grower discuss the loss of her husband saddened me because as she was able to put 2 and 2 together the rest of the world cannot recognize that these pesticides and chemicals are causing cancer, defects, and death among those exposed to it whether rapidly or over time. 
      <br><br>

I believe that, like a garment worker said, the consumers need to realize that the clothes they buy to wear and then throw out were made from the blood and hard work of those under appreciated workers. While Ken explained how the consumers were made to serve the industry, the more consumers buy the more the industry thrives, I still believe that consumers play a big role in the conditions these garment workers are facing. Time after time as more events become devastating the news portrays the consequences of this fast fashion industry and, while it saddens some, it is not enough to get rid of the already embedded materialistic mindset that most people have. People need to understand that material items will not make them happy because, like most items, its will make them happy until it does not leading them to purchase a replacement item thinking that would make them happy too. Our culture has glamorized materialism and with how embedded it already is into our society I believe that it would be extremely difficult to convince people to consume them items because, like some people have said, it will make the economy weak and a weak economy means less money for the money hungry corporations.

I agree with the sentiment-- the documentary was indeed appalling. I didn't know the extent to which the fashion industry preyed on people in developing nations. Perhaps it's because I'm used to seeing the unions and worker's rights activism in America, but it was an "...oh" moment when I realized that there are far more countries that do not have laws in place for labor rights than countries with them. Honestly, I almost rolled my eyes when the film confirmed that-- yet again-- big corporations are soul-sucking, immoral, and heartless. With the rise of people who are becoming more environmentally conscious, however, I've noticed that one of the first things that consumers ask when new clothing brands come up is, "is this ethically sourced?". It's a comforting development. I have more hope for the fashion industry than I do for automobiles because I feel that it is easier to give up buying things that people essentially wear once and discard, as opposed to giving up something that is so intertwined with everyday life.

In the beginning of this film “The True Cost” one of the fashion designers being interviewed said, “We communicate who we are to a certain extent through clothing”. From an external perspective I perceive this to be true, we will buy and wear the clothes that match our “vibe” and what makes us look the most ourselves. It is unfortunate that with this message that means we are also saying “Individually I am someone who will buy these clothes at someone else's expense and suffering”. Making the decision to buy clothes from fast fashion industries is sending the message back to the sweatshop industries that it is okay, that we as people can ignore the abuse of others because we want not only affordable but very cheap clothing. I have seen a few films similar to this one in two different Globalization courses that I have taken here at UCSB and every single time it has been equally heartbreaking. These clothing companies and agriculture companies do anything for a profit, to make the most money they possibly can at the sake of their employees. It is horribly disgusting that if these women stand up for themselves and try to make demands to be treated better (their better would still be considered poor) they can be physically/emotionally/mentally abused, have their wages held sometimes in regards to riots against authorities or as an exchange for sex, and are subjected everyday towards exhaustive work. What these workers give up everyday in order to make a barely living wage is unforgivable; they are practically selling their souls to the corporate version of the devil. 

      <br><br>

When Ken asks us from his video if there’s a better way to inform people about this, one of the lines from this film stood out to me “I don’t want anyone wearing anything, which is produced by our blood”. Every time that I have seen a film similar to this one the message has been engraved into my conscious. It is hard to think that people are able to watch these films and then go back to purchasing clothes from stores where they have made the association these items have been produced by the “blood” of others. As far as thinking of alternative ways to inform other people I think word of mouth is always a crucial tool. Although social media can be seen as a mind-consuming vortex, we are able to use this tool that can reach hundreds, thousands, and millions of people with the tap of a few letters and a tap on “post” spreading awareness instantly. Once again the film for the week has left me feeling sad, frustrated, and angry that we as humanity have created such a selfish world we are willing and seemingly eager to profit off the suffering of our own kind.

I feel like it’s still possible to search for clothing lines that don’t violate basic human rights and exploit oversea low-cost labor. The problem is can we find these companies and more people need to know about them. I believe if more people choose to shop at these places then it could easily put those big conglomerates out of business like what happened recently to Forever 21. I did not feel bad at all that the company had to file for bankruptcy. I think consumers are becoming more conscious about where their clothes are being made. That is another reason why ethical company like Everlane, where I choose to shop, is becoming more mainstream. I promise I’m not promoting for them, but I like how they tell you where their clothes are being made (I’m glad that Bangladesh is not on the list). However, the difference between Everlane and let’s say H&M is that Everlane works directly with these factories so it’s very transparent in terms of how much these workers are being paid and the ethical components involved. The only way we could stop these sweatshops from continuing is to boycott these fast fashion companies. Not sure if you’ve seen the movie, The Devil Wears Prada, but the film mentioned that these fast fashion companies mainly just copy the styles from runaway fashion where outfit ideas are being stolen and sold at a much cheaper price and substantial cost that we often don’t pay attention to. The most heartbreaking scene from The True Cost was when the protest to increase minimum wage turned political and blood was shed for two days. A peaceful community shifted into a battleground… lives were lost on top of what happened at Rana Plaza. The tragedy reminded me of the Triangle Fire (I think that’s what it was called) in New York City. But obviously the garment workers in Bangladesh had it much worse, no comparison. Working conditions for any and all garment workers need to be improved globally. It shouldn’t be looked over in developing countries and it shouldn’t be ignored in first world countries either because not everyone is a white-collar. 
      <br><br>

 It’s especially when pressing when over 80% of these workers are women and some children are included as well. By finding a solution to this problem, we are not only fighting economic injustice but also gender inequality around the world. Honestly, the same line that stood out to you also stood out to me… Even though she was speaking in a different language, I felt the pain and anger in her voice. It resonated with me and made me frustrated to think how unfair lives are… They didn’t choose to be born into that kind of condition. Just like the commentator, I will not be participating in shopping at these fast fashion stores anymore.

Before watching, I have some background about how unethical the fast fashion industry is because I have taken the sociology class last quarter. But I am still shocked. I only know the fashion industry exploit the poor workers in developing countries. However, their unaccountability of workers’ working conditions and minimum wage, and free responsibility of environmental pollution are being exposed to me through this film for the first time. One scene in the film that nearly made me jump up from my chair is a some kind of expert claiming the big brands are providing “better” working conditions for the workers in the third world countries, or the poor people will have to seek out worse jobs in their community. Excuse me? I know this term is called “relative deprivation” in sociology, but what we are discussing now is not how worse the conditions will be. Rather, we are arguing for a responsible solution to their current conditions! The brands are just changing the concepts and calling for attention about what they offer to them rather than what they did not account for. Therefore, if using this logic, every person in this world can say that they are living in bad conditions and find faults with anyone around him/her, even the heads of the corporations. Also, there is one sentence saying “there is no actual danger like coal mining in fashion industry.” True. There should be no danger. But what about the tragedy in Rana Plaza? Should it be counted as danger? Whose fault? Don’t tell me it seems to be an incident of old factory buildings. The workers there have already reported the cracks on the walls and nobody cares. The manager of the factory does not pay any respect to workers’ lives because he only cares about profit. And of course, so do heads of the big brands. They collectively squeeze the margins of the workers and treat them like things. Thus, this industry is not about clothing or garments or fashion trend, but human rights and systematic issue around capitalism.

I am guilty of knowing about the fast fashion industry and still shopping at stores that I know are contributing to the crime. When one of the ladies in the film was asked about whether or not she felt bad about the working conditions of those making our clothes in underdeveloped countries, she flat out said no. I was appalled to hear her blatantly say “there are a lot worse things they could be doing” and not care one bit about how their lives are drastically affected by our consumerism. However, at least she admits it and isn’t a hypocrite like myself and so many others. It’s heartbreaking… yet here I am and here we are buying into it.
      <br><br>

 I have always known this was a problem, but was not aware of the severity of it. The fact that factory owners are “cutting corners” to save money when it comes to safety precautions in the buildings is disgusting. One thousand garment workers died in Dhaka after the factory owner knowingly avoided fixing the broken structure of the building. Those people, who were working for maybe $2 a day, truly did have to pay the price for our big Black Friday sale or some other insanely shallow thing that excites us Americans. All while these tragedies go on across the globe, the fashion industry breaks records for profits. That is because of the demand we consumers put on these clothes; we purchase 400 times the amount of clothes now compared to two decades ago and waste 11 million tons of textile waste annually. The fast fashion industry may be the ones neglecting concern for the factory workers, but they are nothing without their customers, which really puts the fault on us, our priorities, and what we demand. The fashion industry is the second most polluting industry, just after oil, so not only are we killing the desperately hard working, innocent laborers in other countries, but our planet too. 
      <br><br>

 The scene that stuck with me the most was the montage towards the end. They switched from the Black Friday crowds, to a child worker, to runway models, to overworked and underprivileged female garment workers, and went back and forth truly showing the cause and effects of our consumptionism. Our choices and actions directly affect the lives of people we do not know and cannot see, but should be caring about. I am saying this now, in writing, on the internet, with my name posted to hold me accountable: I will put a larger effort into becoming more aware of how my consumption affects others and make choices that are more ethically and environmentally friendly.

The videos of last week and this week have really opened my mind up to the materialism of the world. In the past I've always been interested in products. Nowadays, I find myself becoming more and more uncomfortable with the scary amount of superficiality I sense whenever I watch advertisements, read magazines, look at billboards, and observe the world around me. One of the men in the film said that "the way to solve the problems of your life... is through consumption". This scares me. In reality, not only do we turn to consumption to solve our problems, but consumption turns to us to create those problems. We see commercials for anti-frizz shampoos, weight-loss pills, fast food, mint gum, steak from Arby's, modern cars, better phones, acne creams, mascara, makeup removers, and more. These products spark interest in us, as they either satisfy our desires or claim to make our lives easier. However, imagine if none of these products existed. We wouldn't think about the problems they claim to solve, as we wouldn't know of the problems in the first place. The best example I have is the Aqua Globe, a product I saw in many commercials as a child. It's a bulb that waters your plants for you. Should that product never have been invented, everyone would water their plants themselves and wouldn't think twice about an easier way. However, the idea that an easier way exists plants doubt in a person's mind and increases the chance that some people will want to buy the product in an effort to make their normal routine effortless. 
      <br><br>

This makes me think about Wall-E, the Disney movie that takes place in the future. In the movie, people have left a destroyed Earth and they move around on electronic chairs on a space craft called Axiom. According to Wall-E's IMDb page, meaning of the word Axiom is "something that is taken for granted." On the Axiom, all the people talk to each other through screens and listen to a voice through an intercom tell them about "everything [they] need to be happy" and "feel beautiful". At one point, the voice says to "try blue" and everyone presses a button on their mobile chairs and automatically changes their outfit color from red to blue. The people follow the voice's suggestions like blind mice. They are controlled by it. It is their lord. That is exactly what consumption has become -- our lord. In the movie, a woman sits in her chair and complains about the guy she is dating to her friend on the screen. She wishes she could find someone who wasn't "so superficial." Wall-E comes over and unplugs her screen. Suddenly, she is confused. She looks at all of the billboards around her. They say "live your dreams", "be anyone", "NEW", "drink", and finally, "buy now, pay later". The last one blew my mind. Think about it: if you buy something, you're paying for it. So how could you buy now and pay later? Well, the billboard means consuming and paying in the form of consequences. We consume mindlessly now, and later we will find we have to pay for the detrimental effects of our consumerism. In response to the billboards, all the woman in the movie says is "Huh?" which translates directly to the ignorance and confusion we have when faced with the widely incomprehensible idea that the climate crisis is our biggest impending doom. 
      <br><br>

The problem of consumerism, and particularly fast fashion, lies within the people. A big problem with fast fashion is online-shopping and the transportation of products. This problem didn't exist until recently (1995). People went centuries without online-shopping. You might think we could go back to that. Unfortunately, that's probably impossible. Fashion is inevitable. Fashion is important. It allows us to express ourselves. It has become so important that costs have gone down and popularity has gone up. Furthermore, people always want a more efficient way to get their clothes, and that way is online-shopping. To the world's demise, this increase in the access to and interest in fashion means there is a need for more people who will work for less. So, countries turn to countries such as Bangladesh. This brings us to the biggest problem: the horrible and unfair working conditions and situations (as evident in The True Cost). It is horribly unjust that the entire fashion system is carried by the most vulnerable and the worst paid and carried out in ways that don't consider the environment. In the film, they talk about the collapse of a garment factory in Bangladesh where the managers knew about cracks in the walls but did nothing to fix them. Later, they talk about abuse in the factories. Finally, they talk about pesticide use in farming, which causes illness in people and degradation of the environment. These are just a few examples of unjust treatment in the garment industry. How could we let this happen to the very people who supply us with everything we think we "need"?
      <br><br>

In simple terms, we are ignoring other peoples' lives. When it comes down to it, the climate crisis is a problem of ignorance and a problem of selfishness. In the film, people refuse to deny the dangers and unfairness of sweatshops, and instead they focus on the benefits such as employing people (especially women) who would otherwise be unemployed and struggling. Employment is great, but how is that employment even a beneficial factor if workers are paid less than $3 a day?
      <br><br>

My favorite part of The True Cost is the compilation of clothing haul videos from Youtube. I grew up mindlessly watching these videos. I would be inspired by the influencers' fashion, and many times the videos prompted me to go out -- or rather, go online -- and shop. The film shows how the influencers would showcase their clothes and romanticize how they "bought so many things" such as a "jean button-up thing", "a gray knit sweater", "tie dye things", a shirt with a "yin yang sign" on it, and "a really pretty light blue sweater" that one influencer wasn't sure she was even going to wear because she didn't actually like it that much. I found myself laughing at the very videos I admired as a child. This really made me think about how much I have changed and how much the world has changed in the past 10 years.
      <br><br>

Unfortunately, the films we have been watching have made me feel terribly stuck and hopeless. However, I think that that is exactly how I need to feel. They have made me more observant in my daily life and now I feel as though I am more likely to make a change in my individual consumption. It's like the fight or flight response, except the fear is so strong that the flight response is not an option. The only option is to take action.

I agree if we knew how our clothes was being made we wouldn’t feel so happy or proud of our new clothing. Recently I learned the violence behind avocados from Mexico and when I told my roommate that loves avocados she was shocked and saddened by the truth. Also, in my class a girl shared that cashews (I think?) lead to irreversible damage to women’s fingers/hands and are not being paid enough. With all this knowledge I have started to wonder of the ways I consume and if the pain someone else is going through. 
      <br><br>
The film was hard to watch as I saw how people were affected and burdened with the job to produce clothes for people that do not even know. The fact that the people working so hard to produce the clothing do not even get paid anything to make a living really angers me. Learning about the factory collapse that killed many people made me sad because I did not know how little other people’s life matters to the corporations. I know that I am part of the problem as I have bought from stores that get their production from these badly treated workers and I will use this lesson to make better choices with where I shop and also consider the sacrifice and pain people in other parts of the world go through.

Wall-E from an environmental perspective. Great analogy. As you stated, I believe the world's problem (pretty much just the United States) in this environmental disaster is our turn to consumption to fulfill our lives and in turn, our addiction to consumption is what fuels the fast fashion industry. I never paid much attention to the environmental injustice advertisements are guilty of before starting college and now everywhere I see an advertisement, I question its purpose. Most of my comments tie back to American consumer culture because I truly believe it is the root issue to climate change. If people got rid of the desire to constantly buy things to fulfill their lives, the lack of consumerism would cause industries to slow production and exploitation of natural resources and land would also slow down. The problem is culture and lack of an environmental mindset.

<br><hr>
There are truly so many problems with fast fashion and the habits of consumption that have taken over our society today, and these are things we worship like "blind mice" as Leanne mentioned above. I think the analogy of Wall-E is great, because these people mindlessly follow the trends and what they are told to do - to their demise. The Patriot Act shows how fast-fashion companies can knockoff "high-fashion" items within 24 hours such as a dress Kim-Kardashian wore, and sell it for only $60. This just shows people can be like the "blind mice" that just follow what is thrown at them - is Kim Kardashian really someone we should be looking up to for how we live our lives, from the clothes we wear to the ideal consumerist lifestyle that is in many people's minds? 

      <br><br>

Another thing that concerned me from watching the Patriot Act was how H&M and Zara put on a facade through "Greenwashing," where they scam customers into the image and belief that these companies are "green" and eco-friendly" when they are really the worst for the environment. H&M's "sorting program" and Zara's "sustainable clothing line" are all a facade to trick the consumer into buying. This is a crazy and unnerving fact how much power these corporations have over the psyche of the American consumers and how they lie and cheat to make a buck - in turn hurting us and the environment.

<br><hr>

Wow I couldn’t agree more with you. This video made me think hard about our society and what it is that makes up want to buy things and always want the newest trend. The problem with fast fashion in my opinion is largely the cost. When I was younger, I loved shopping (I have no idea why, because now I absolutely hate it!) but I had to buy all of the things that I did not absolutely need myself. My parents raised me to be very money conscious and gave me a small amount of money each week for allowance while simultaneously having extra chores that I could do on top of my normal chores to receive a little more money. This taught me how to be frugal. The problem is a compromise between being frugal and loving shopping is fast fashion. Places like forever 21 and H&M are store where you can buy lots of things for such a small price. Now retrospectively looking back I want to tell everyone to stop shopping at these places, but I am a little conflicted because I think about those people who can’t afford clothing and need to shop at these places to have things to wear. However, on the flip side If we were to change our culture so it wasn’t wrong, gross, or weird to wear the same out fits over and over we could likely deal with this issue. 
       <br><br>

As you said we are targeted so frequently with these adds advertising and array of products that are in my opinion absolute jokes.. but to some people they latch on to them. If we were able to completely eliminate these adds or exchange them to a short video that actually showed what was taking place behind these products people might think about what they bought before they bought it. Thinking of that I was absolutely horrified when I saw the piece in the film that showed the building collapse and thousands of workers die. The most horrifying part was how I had no idea that that had even occurred, and it was mostly due to the consumer culture in America causing that destruction. What if instead of showing commercials filled with useless products, we showed videos of real things that were going on in our world; such as the problems with fast fashion, and how air travel is affecting the environment, and what is really happening with climate change. Maybe with these steps forward we could take footsteps int eh right direction.    
       <br><br>

I really liked the parallel you drew between Wall-E. That movie really freaked me out as a kid. In the age that I was I couldn’t figure out why I hated the movie so much but looking back I definitely know why. Wall-E is a futuristic movie of what is going to happen to us if we don’t take action now and figure out a way to combat our needs of consumption. I don’t know how to combat this issue, but I do believe it starts with advertisement; but advertisement of what is actually taking place and moving us away from consumption and towards the health of the planet and other human beings. I agree, our only option is to take action.


<br><hr>

I agree with everything you said. After watching The True Cost, and seeing the horrendous and catastrophic event that took place in Bangladesh, what really is the true cost of fast fashion and consumerism in general? Western countries are making huge strides in revolutionizing fashion, but are making large sums of profit in expense of the lives of innocent people. On top of that, it is upsetting to see the environment in which our clothes are made, and effect on health, and the extremely low amount of pay the workers receive. You would think that since these individuals are working for 3 trillion dollar industries, some of that money could and would be put into those who fabricated the items in the first place. 
       <br><br>

I was absolutely struck when the woman who formed a union told her story on the time the workers asked for better working standards. What saddened me was the fact that the laborers were beaten and physically abused for a change in policy. The result of their voice was violence, and if anything, what they most likely learned from that altercation was that speaking up for what you believe in will be your downfall. I cannot stress enough how saddening this is, especially in third world countries where there are high levels of poverty and unemployment to begin with. 
        <br><br>

The thing is, most consumers do not even think about who makes the clothes they purchase. Like you said, we are ignoring other people’s lives. We are selfish, greedy, and downright ignorant towards the fact that large western companies are putting countless lives at stake for the exchange of cheap production. Personally, I am a huge shopper and never took into consideration where and how the clothing items were made. Watching this documentary made me feel quite shameful for not considering the horrible factory conditions in which they were made, and really did open my eyes to what is really going on behind the scenes.
<br><hr>

It is such a sad reality to see the scope of the negative impact of rampant consumerism. It's terrible to see how destructive the entire industry could be to every aspect that it touches. As shown in the movie The True Cost, the production of such a large number of clothes for so cheap puts millions of lives in danger in all the sweatshops existing I third world countries, it destroys local environments at the source of production as well as the rest of the world through all the transportation that occurs moving the goods to distribution, as well as corrupting the societies of the places that purchase and "consume" the clothes. It is evident that the whole system must go. An important first step would be to create better safety laws in third world countries, or create tax incentives for locally sourced materials for the clothing companies in 1st world countries.  Additionally, more documentaries like this will hopefully be able to spread awareness to consumers, I for one will try my best to research companies before buying their clothes, and I won't throw clothes out when they get worn out, but rather will try to fix them. Hopefully people will see repairing clothes and avoiding dangerous brands as an easier thing to do than most other environmentally conscious changes, and the fast fashion industry can soon just be a painful memory of the horrors of the early 21st century.

<br><hr>
Thank you for your comment. I totally agree with you. If every product we bought could tell the story of where it actually came from, consumerism would be much less popular. When we are at the store buying something, whether it’s a shirt or car, we only see the end product on display. The only part of the product that shows where the product originated is the “Made in _____” label in fine print. Consumers buy products unknowingly. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, millions of people are working to earn less than $3 a day in labor intensive and deadly environments just produce goods for Americans. In Bangladesh, factory environments are so poor that buildings collapse and catch fire, killing thousands. This is outrageous. How can we happily purchase clothes knowing it was made by under paid and over worked people? In a way we are responsible for this. When we see a dirt-cheap t-shirt on the rack of a store, there is a horrifying story behind it. The film said this very accurately. We are wearing the blood of garment workers. As this cycle continues, clothing companies are only getting richer and richer.
        <br><br>

I also liked your comparison between Disney’s Wall-E and our society today. This movie is an accurate parallel to our society today. The movie Wall-E was meant to be a fictional dystopian society where Earth is inhabitable. Wall-E is responsible for cleaning up left on Earth. The humans in Wall-E are locked onto their screens and brainwashed by advertisements. It is these advertisements that are triggering the consumerism culture. Our current Earth is quickly becoming the Earth portrayed in Wall-E.

I have been noticing the tactics that companies use for swaying their audience to purchase something. When I was younger, I remember watching the same advertisements repeatedly on TV. I even remember asking my mom one day if I could get a Pillow Pet. Fast forward to today, I advertisements still influence my decisions, but not nearly as much. Just the other day, I went to watch a video on Youtube and had to watch four advertisements before watching the actual video I intended to watch. The advertising industry will do just about anything to influence consumers to purchase their product. You are right, the issue of consumerism is because of us. We are allowing advertising companies to influence our decisions and the way we spend our money. Unfortunately, nothing will change unless we change the way we think about our purchases.
<br><hr>
I agree with you, if we could see the production behind all the purchases we make,  we wouldn’t be rejoicing on how good of a deal we got. I am the same in that I have grown more skeptical of all these advertisements. Our society today is so materialistic, we have convinced ourselves that we can’t be happy unless we are able to buy more and more objects. I totally agree with you that today products present to us problems we weren’t even aware we had.

Online shopping has made buying cheap clothing extremely easy. It is extremely unjust that a large part of the fashion industry has turned to the needy countries for the production of fast and cheap fashion. It was extremely unnerving learning of the collapse of a garment factory in Bangladesh, where over 1000 people died because the managers forced their employees to work despite the obvious cracks in the building. It’s so terrible that these people who are just trying to make a honest living, are subjected to these horrific conditions. Money makes us forget that we are all human. This film made me realize that Western companies are greedy and selfish, they don’t care about the consumers or the employees, their main goal is to make profit. Thankfully, this documentary has taught me to be more aware and do research of the things I buy.

After watching "The True Cost", I felt similar sentiments towards how engrossed we have become in meaningless consumerism. This film gave me a really informative perspective about all the aspects that go into the creation of a single piece of clothing. After seeing the amount of pesticides go into cotton and the terrible working conditions that so many garment workers are forced to live with, I felt guilty of being a consumer of such goods being manufactured in these sweatshops. In the film, there was a clothing brand owner who brought up a good point. Today, clothing companies are designing clothes without taking into the people who are making the garment. These designs are just carelessly sent off to manufacturers and are expected to be made at a low cost; if not, the company simply decides to find another manufacturing plant to do so for less. When considering fast fashion, I believe that companies need to completely change their approach. Rather than just focusing on the consumer, the companies need to take into account the livelihood of their workers. Unfortunately, many people in the the developed world tend to rely on cheap clothes because it is the only affordable option. As thrifting and shopping secondhand is becoming more popular, I hope that people will take a step further and learn more about the environmental and social harms that fast fashion has on those who are making the clothing.

The film “The True Cost” made me sad and angry on behalf of the millions of people suffering at the hands of a few greedy and wealthy people. I also agree that since learning about the horrific conditions garment workers suffer in, I find advertisements for the fashion industry superficial and absolutely disgusting. Not only is it terrible that these companies target people’s insecurities and promise to fix them through their products, thereby creating a constant stream of consumers who are buying stuff they don’t need, they are exploiting human lives to do so. I was shocked that America outsources 97% of its clothing production. It’s appalling to see the working conditions that these people face; even the way corporations try to justify the working conditions by saying they are giving these women better opportunities than what they will find otherwise is disgusting and just a facade for them to continuously take advantage of the poor. The “better” working conditions that these women face are actually dangerous environments containing health hazards such as chemical spills or gas leaks that would never be found in the U.S. because we have laws in place mandating safe working environments. However, because corporations only care about maximizing profit under the capitalist system and will outsource their production to countries that don’t have such laws in place, workers in other countries end up suffering. The worst of these conditions was seen in the Dhaka fire in 2012; more than 100 women died from a sweatshop fire because the factory did not take the proper precautions. The working conditions in Bangladesh are completely inhumane, and if corporations aren’t going to do the right thing by ensuring safe working environments and paying their workers decent wages, then consumers should do their part by boycotting these corrupt and immoral companies. There are so many alternatives we can turn to instead of being complacent in this inhumanity - donating our used clothes, buying from thrift stores and resale stores, and even making your own clothing are all much better alternatives than to support companies like H&M.

I am taken aback by your perfect comparison to The True Cost documentary and the Disney movie Wall-E. Wall-E was one of the first shows/movie/educational thing that exposed me to the reality of climate change and the negative effects that humans have on the planet. I distinctly remember the happy ending where the small plant was a glimmer of hope for the repopulation of earth after living in space for that long, but now I am slightly more pessimistic than the innocent child who first watched Wall-E and Planet Earth. When I was 8, I watched James Cameron's Avatar and I was turned off by the representation of human impact on virgin soil. I was disgusted and didn't want to acknowledge our impact on the earth. 
        <br><br>
A few years later, when I got into middle school, I went to my first slumber party. Our only objective was to go shopping, that was the first time I ever stepped into Forever 21, and I still remember the shirt I got that day. That would not be the last time I went into Forever 21; I shopped there and bought pieces of clothing I would be horrified to wear now, but new clothes were new clothes and every 11 year old was wearing Forever 21. When I was in elementary school I would wear a shirt that was about recycling and it showed the steps of Reusing, Reducing, and Recycling; this was my favorite shirt for the longest time, until I started shopping at Forever 21 or H&M and I started purchasing graphic tee shirts with stupid logos on it from shows I didn't even watch or bands I had never heard of. If I saw certain items from haul vlogs on YouTube then I had to have it. 
        <br><br>
This is our culture, but I do believe it can change. We desperately need to educate the youth.



<br><hr>

Yes! If we could see all the processes that led up to someone wearing a piece of clothing it would drastically change how cool we think they are. After learning so much that I didn't know from “The True Cost,” I think that the main disconnect is the difference between what is tangible and what is not. We can physically see how fashionable or comfortable looking an article of clothing is, but we really don’t know where it was sourced, who made it and how, or if it was reused from the past generation. I am now looking at a lot of influencers who I look up to and think are really cool people, and am specifically rattled by how much of their image really is just them having brand new expensive things. The idea of living life in their shoes, literally, is so intertwined with how cool we think they are.From the knowledge I had before this class, I knew that it was eco-friendly to wear vintage things, but I now see that I shouldn’t be looking at it like that is the exception: I should be looking at the brand new bright and shiny things are the problem, and everything else as the norm.
<br><hr>
Your comment really resonated with me because I related a lot to the part where you talked about influencer fashion. Influencers are called influencers for a reason, it’s because they have influence, and I feel like many of them are using their powers recklessly. They have helped corporations create a culture where the more stuff you have is better. This is especially problematic because of their influence on youth. Corporations are purposefully using them and their audience in order to target the youth. It reminds me of one of Ken’s videos where he mentioned that he saw an ad on a kid’s channel where a commercial for a makeup brand played. I’ve also seen this trend about makeup and Instagram. For makeup, even though all you really need is a couple of basics, brands and beauty influencers have effectively convinced their audience that even though they already have 3 palettes with very similar or identical colors, they MUST buy this new palette because of name slapped on the box or because this influencer endorsed it. The same goes for Instagram. Like Hasan mentioned in The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion, people are often pressured to have a different outfit in each post in order to seem cool or trendy.

<br><hr>
As you said, the problem is greed and ignorance. The consumer is happy to remain ignorant as long as society supports their values and the corporation is eager to exploit the consumer’s laziness in its pursuit of infinite economic growth. As long as the consumer is getting fed what it wants, then the human and environmental costs that come with the process are largely ignored and perpetuated. The True Cost really sobered me to the human suffering that greedy and powerful corporations often create, and I can’t help but see how we are inevitably a part of the problem. We have been conditioned to focus on ourselves in the pursuit of success, and it becomes easy to ignore the implications of our actions. The example you use about the youtube clothing haul videos really drives home the point of just how blinded we have become by materialism and propriety: we spiritlessly romanticize having the most things and the latest and greatest in the pursuit of happiness. I am optimistic about the future, but, as you said, change starts with action and initiative.

I like this film, the true cost, so much. I think the film is effective at communicating its subject. As I think the subject of the theme is telling people, who may not release this problem before or don't know how worse is the problem, around the world the problem we have. Wake those people up, let more and more people know this, which can give pressure to those companies and make a change. I think the film's audience is everyone. This film can dress the attention of casual viewers and let the people who already concerned about the issue have a deeper insight. In fact, I am not surprised by this problem. As I have watched a similar film before. I am shocked when I first saw it. I can't believe they treat the worker in this way. The workers don't get an even paycheck for what they did, which is sad. And the clothes we waste each year. This is a disaster for our environment. After I watched this film, I think we should make a change to protect our environment and I feel fortunate for borning in a nice country compare to those workers. This is a really nice film. I rate this film as a 5 star. It teaches people a lot, and make them have a reflection on what they have done. I will recommend it to my friends.

Hasan Minhaj's "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" is a great video that successfully criticized the “fast fashion” culture and the companies who are making “fast fashion” clothes, which only focus on their profits rather than the environment, such as Zara and H&M. In the video, he mentions that in the 1980s, the average number of clothing that American bought annually were twelve. Right now, however, due to the widespread consumer culture and fast fashion, averagely speaking, each individual in America will buy 68 new pieces of clothing per year. With the help of the advertisements, like Ken mentions in his lecture about the ladies putting on make-ups on the beach which makes young girls as the audience, instead of trying to sell their products, they are actually “making consumers.” More than that, fashion advertisements also created an environment of “see now, buy now” to the consumers, encouraging their purchase on the cheap, disposable clothes.
        <br><br>
Furthermore, Ken’s lecture mentions that when talking about who caused this fast fashion trend to become popular, the corporations blamed the consumers by saying that “we made these clothes only to reach the demand of consumers.” Although buyers can be blamed on this issue, the chief culprits are the companies. In order to make the people purchase their products frequently, the fast fashion companies such as Zara think of the techniques like “Quick Response Manufacturing”, which reduces the process between designing to release garments to a short period, and “Dynamic Assortment”, which means constantly launching the new products. Moreover, these companies even try to make themselves as being more “green” than they actually are by utilizing “green washing” just for the sake of letting the people believe that they are sustainable and willing to continue purchasing their products. These companies which lead the trend of fast fashion only care about their profits, despite the fact like it takes about 10330 liters of water to grow the cotton for making one jacket or 33 percent of viscose in garments actually come from aged forest. 
        <br><br>
Consumerism and fast fashion culture must be stopped, and people should take their actions right now.

To be honest, I was shocked after watching this film. Clothes, even the cloth industry, is highly related to our daily life. I used to think that people all over the world should have a better life and living environment with the declination in the price of clothes, because a price declination means the improvement of the social productivity in some level. But the “true cost” behind it is quite beyond my imagination: the price declination is the result of cutting down the profits of workers, and even the rights to work safely and keep alive were taken away in some way. Some workers tried to group as a union to negotiate with the managers to adjust the lowest wage standard, to have a safe environment to work in. But the only thing they finally got was unlimited suppression. Moreover, with the rapid growth in demand for clothes, the demand for cotton also rises. The consequence was the industrialization of farmlands: farmers use pesticide and fertilizer much more often and widely, which increase the rate of getting cancer.
         <br><br>

We, the customers, can do something to stop this. If the sacrifice, the true cost, of the low-price “fast fashion” is to destroy the environment, to lose human rights, and to divest workers of their health and lives. I do not think it is worthy.
         <br><br>

I feel optimistic when I hear that the big companies said that they are willing to elevate the lowest wage and to help workers. However, when those big companies refuse when it is time to make LAWS to protect the workers. “We should not limit the free trade, so we cannot make laws,” they said. This might be one of the reasons why they refuse to make laws, but I believe the main reason is they weigh more on money than other people’s life.

I agree that major fashion industries care more about profit than the lives of their producers. I think that many of these corporations turn a blind eye to the conditions of their producers because they are outsourced to countries around the world and are not actively witnessing their working conditions. By being ignorant, they do not have to address the problems which would potentially affect profit. This situation truly encompasses the saying “ignorance is bliss”.
         <br><br>

I also agree with your idea that as the customers, we can do something about this. As Ken mentioned in his video, the fast fashion industry can be blamed on the consumer and on the corporation, but I believe if real changes are going to be made, it needs to start at the consumer level. Mega corporations are obviously not making any steps to alleviate the problems caused by large scale consumerism, because if they were, they would impede on their profits. The fair-trade clothing company, People Tree, really stood out to me in this documentary. I think it is really important that clothing companies like these are becoming more popular and mainstream because it shifts the attention away from corporations with poor labor practices. As a consumer, I would like to become more conscious about where I purchase my clothing as I have realized that it can have extreme consequences.

The film, “A True Cost” cast an overwhelming sadness over me. It was really disgusting to realize real people, just less fortunate than us, have to suffer in order to produce a 10 dollar t-shirt that we want from H&M. As the film notes, less than 60 years ago Americans were making 95% of our own clothes. Now, we only make 3% of it and the other 97% of it is outsourced from other countries. It has become a huge American norm to rely on outside countries for our goods and its for one reason: because they’re cheap. 
         <br><br>

The film gives many statistics on the fashion industry. 1 out of 6 people in the world work in some part of the global fashion industry. Bangladesh and Cambodia have the worst sweat shop conditions and the factory managers are extremely violent with their employees. In those underdeveloped countries, they practice cutting corners with their business regulations which puts workers at real risks. It makes the garment workers pay the price for fast fashion industries and keeping in mind that those workers are mostly young vulnerable girls with small children. If getting a building dropped on thousands of people isn’t enough to convince us that fast fashion is a serious problem setting aside the environmental impacts, but on humanity, I don't know what else will convince us to change our bad habits. What was even more daunting was the pesticides used to create this hybrid cotton plant in order to keep up with the speed of the high demand in the fast fashion industry. The side effects on local children and farmers were sickening because corporations are literally putting peoples lives on the line just to benefit from cheap quick labor. In the context of this video, the corporation is to blame and Thoreau would agree with this. The taste for American consumerism could’ve been controlling if it weren’t for the businesses and corporations that continued to feed consumers and create inhuman working conditions to help bring in the bloody profits.

Yes, I agree with your points. I also feel staggering and astonishing to realize that there is such a tragic happening in the world around me. I have never noticed it before. Fast Fashion creates thousands of industries chains that gather poor women working in a dangerous and unsafe environment to produce cheap clothes. Fast Fashion then provides us with cheap and new clothes and we have joy. What about those girls in factories? Also, tracing to the origin of clothes, BT cotton, as a new raw material to clothes, can harm soil and water. Having so many disadvantages, why is Fast Fashion so fascinated for us?  Is it because we are lured by those Youtubers? We do feel happy after shopping but it is short-time happiness, right? Sooner or later, we worried about our test scores, salaries, relationships. 
         <br><br>
However, I think of the second point which might be totally opposite from what the film wants to express. Is it really bad to have Fast Fashion? Fast Fashion creates jobs for third world countries and their people which accumulate capital to develop. These countries need opportunities to develop and developed countries like the United States and Europeans also accumulated capital before they could develop by having raw materials from other countries in honest. These countries cannot stay silent and their people need to eat and long for a better living environment and education which costs a huge amount of money. All of these reasons produce conflicts and we need a balance. For people in developed countries, we can buy less clothes and for people in developing countries, we can create better working conditions for them compared to the one in the past.


<br><hr>
I have the same feeling with you. The film “The True Cost” provides the striking statistics such as 1000 people died because of the Rana Plaza Collapse and 97% of U.S. clothes are outsourced to developing countries. These numbers are interrelated, showing how big corporations of Fast Fashion industries do whatever they can to fulfill their huge profits. Besides, I am deeply depressed when I see the comparison between scenarios of the beautiful models who wear gorgeous clothes and the arduous, poor, and sick labors in the underside of apparel industries. By utilizing statistics, contrast, personal stories, and interviews of experts, this film effectively inform me the huge problems in the supply chain of fashion industry. I feel very sad when it presents the workers with health illness including jaundice, skin rashes, blisters, pustules, and even cancer since they are born. I hope there could be more people like Safia Minnet, the CEO of People Tree, who gives great consideration to poor manufacturers and takes care of the environment. 
         <br><br>

At the same time, I really like Ken’s example of the advertisement in the TV shows for 6-year-old girls. When children are surrounded by numerous advertising information andYoutube videos telling them the importance of cosmetics, fashionable clothes, and other stuffs, it’s almost inevitable for them to become a generation of insatiable consumers. The fashion industries are exactly those who behind these advertisements. They create the whole consumerism cultural systems, along with the capitalist economy, and continuously oppress human beings and natural resources. I believe that an immediate action against these corporations is required if we want to save our planet and our people.

Watching this documentary actually brought tears to my eyes. It really hurt to see how people in Bangladesh and India were being forced to work in such terrible conditions just to satisfy some rich person's useless desires. I think this is one of the best examples of America's carbon footprint affecting poorer countries more than it affects itself. One of the parts that angered me the most was when the former sourcing manager Kate Ball-Young stated that she didn't feel sorry for people working in sweatshops because "they're doing a job". Yes, they are doing a job but they are being reduced to slaves while they're doing them. If our own countrymen were required to go into a poorly built factory with dangerous equipment to make only $2 a day, we would be outraged. So why is it okay to exploit people in other countries in ways we would never tolerate?
         <br><br>

Another thing that stuck out to me was how Mark Miller, professor of media culture at NYU likened advertisements to propaganda. I never thought of it that way, but it makes sense. Propaganda is spread in order to get people to do something, with the negative effects of that thing never being publicized, and that is exactly what advertisements do. If more people knew what they were seeing was not the whole story, they would be more careful about how they spent their money.
         <br><br>

In response to Ken, I do believe that initially, the producers were responsible for making the public feel like they needed to buy more things, but as time has passed, I think the consumers no longer need convincing. It is now something we do independently, especially because of how things become trendy so quickly. Also, like Guido Brera mentioned in the documentary, necessities, like a home, a car, an education, etc. have become too expensive to afford so instead of saving up for those things, people seek happiness through small things, like clothes. Producers don't have to appeal to us as much, because consumers will naturally try to buy stuff they associate with contentment.

 Watching the video brought me to the same response.  I knew those who worked in sweatshops were not in the best conditions, I knew they were not highly paid, but I never expected them to be subjected to such awful terms. And seeing what happened and the deaths in Bangladesh broke my heart. They had warned the company of the walls and still, no precaution was taken. After being just completely devastated with that scene I became frustrated, not only because people like Kate Ball-Young were trying to justify the company's wrong-doings and saying that "they're doing a job" but the fact that as Americans we are either buying that false information or being shielded from the truths of what's really going on. I know that personally I have had no information of the Bangladesh incident and I am sure that many Americans do not either. While I do think that This is partly because the media is shielding us from it and providing more commercials to buy more products.  
         <br><br>


Another point in the film I felt frustrated about was concerning donations. The fact that only 10% of donations to places like goodwill is actually resold in stores and the rest is dumped in third world countries, absolutely blew my mind. My whole life I always felt good about donating my clothes in hopes that they will be reused and not sent to waste. But yet it turns out to be another 'miscommunication' and not the whole truth. It really makes me want to rethink the way I am living.

         <br><br>

Lastly, I fully agree with your comment about consumers no longer needed convincing.  I have never looked at a commercial and say to myself oh I need to go buy more clothes now or oh I need to buy that item. But I do find myself saying oh I have an event to go to Friday, I need to buy a new outfit for it. This is something instilled in me, something I was possibly taught while being raised. This is an issue that might be hard for others to admit too, making it something that is hard to address. But after this film, I can say with confidence that I am going to be more conscious of my buying and using from now on.
<br><hr>
This documentary was nearly impossible to watch since it told and showed the stories of people who have been subjected to such horrors, all to fulfill the needs of others. Even though it was incredibly difficult to watch, I am so glad it was made because these truths need to come to light in order for anyone to do anything about it. Being as informed as possible helps me make better decisions in what I purchase and telling other people the consequences of their actions. There are so many components that make up this terrible, exploitative industry and it is hard to see it ever changing, let alone come to an end. I am always curious as to whether the people who make documentaries about tragedies, considering it takes money to make a film, do anything to help the people they are interviewing, since they know the hardships or evils they have faced or continue to face. There might not be too much one can do, but maybe a little money could go a long way in helping someone out; yet again there are so many people that are subjected to this lifestyle. 

         <br><br>

I do not think working in terrible conditions as were portrayed in the film were in any way a voluntary choice. Working in an unsafe and extremely low paying job is something people are forced into by other people’s choices; this would not be necessary if corporations, businesses, and consumers all did not demand such cheap and competitive clothing. Everyone is affected, from farmers to workers to citizens who are not even involved in the processes but still have to live with the impacts of a dirty business. The fashion industry is ruining lives and I cannot forgive the people at the top, or even middle, who put others in this position. I am so hurt that I can live a life of relative luxury, health, and privilege while children are dying and people are beaten for trying to live better lives. I am sick that so many people have to deal with pain for their entire lives…I just want to lessen their burden in any way possible. Watching and hearing about this also gives me anxiety because I know I cannot make it better for everyone involved, which leads me to think that it might be easier for me to not think too much about all the sad things happening around the world at any given second. I feel pessimistic.

The film "The true cost" leads the viewers to see the dark side of the fashion industry, showing workers are working in the high-risk environment and receiving low salary. At the same time the fast rotation of fashion brings large amount of wastes and chemicals which are harmful to the environment. The audience of the film is people who follows and produces fashion. People working in this area may notice the problem existing in the third-world countries, but some of them do not care about it because only higher profits are things they want. However, there are still a bunch of people concern this social issue, which may affect many workers’ lives, so the film was produced to appeal to more viewers, telling us the fashion industry has became corrupted, and we have to change it. After watching the film, I was surprised and angry. I feel the film reflects a cycle in fashion industry, and it gradually makes the world and people worse. The film may successfully changes some of views’ thoughts, letting them avoiding to buy more unused cloths. However, it do not have enough power to change the standard of the fashion industry. Only associated with large organizations, such as governments, creating policies to protect the bottom worker and environment and appeal to consumers preventing buying more unwanted products. I believe it will change a little bit, but it needs a lot of time and work. I still feel powerless and concerned.

The documentary “The True Cost” presents us how a typical fashion industry works. From the aspect of environment, the movie discussed how the production process could lead to various environmental damage such as pollution and contamination of rivers and soil, pesticide contamination, disease and death. Besides, it reveals how the basic workers are exploited for the  benefit of the industry and striving for their minimum wage while having no working condition guaranteed. It also draw on the thought-provoking question that whether materialistic life could bring true happiness to life.

“Fast and Disposable” are the key aspects of fast fashion change the whole retail environment. ZARA has a strong and highly effective 14 days from new designs development to production then ready-to-sell. Brands like H&M and ZARA sell people pieces of luxury by offering an affordable price point. Disposable aspect of fast fashion is the worst thing of fast fashion by being a game changer of the whole retail environment. Traditional fashion seasons are Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter, but fast fashion retailers spin up the whole seasons by pushing new collections every two months. Consumers are being spoiled by fast fashion that they constantly purchase things they do not really need, “64 new articles of apparel per American” is a horrible number that release a sign of waste. Especially the fashion production process could emit multiple pollution and wastes to the environment. It is understandable for consumers to look chic and fashionable at a good price point. However, the waste is really terrifying.

When I heard Professor Ken say that the average american buys about 64 items of clothing every year I was really surprised. The amount of clothing I buy is not even close to the amount the average american buys a year. I think that I buy about half the amount of clothing that the average american buys. You say that companies are “new collections every two months” which means that people may be buying more clothes to fit a new fashion trend. 
         <br><br>

 Styles always come back in fashion. There is a saying that “There is nothing new under the sun”. I feel that this is true even with Fast fashion because old trends always come back but these companies make their money by convincing you that you should throw away the old. For example Doc Martens were a very fashionable shoe in the 80’s and early 90’s but they “went out of style” now you see young ladies trying to get their hands on them again. If Their Mothers and Fathers had just saved their shoes then the individuals today could have reused them. I have a friend who still wears all of her mom's old 80’s clothes just because her mother never threw them away and she likes the style. We should get in the habit of reusing items rather than throwing them away. Get away from the facade that fast fashion tries to portray.

The film's subject of fast fashion was present and communicated effectively throughout the film. The footage of the terrible conditions of the cramped and hot atmosphere and the meager pay opens our minds about the inhumane way these workers are treated. The owners and large corporations are trying to justify the barbaric treatment of their workers by making them work in these conditions to lower costs down because of the economic growth sustained through cheaper clothes. By giving true insight into what is happening behind the scenes from multiple perspectives, we can understand the true subject that creates the film.

         <br><br>

 I walked into the film expecting a firmly intellectual view on the manner since I was also just a casual viewer with no prior knowledge of the subject; however, through the film I had more of an emotional reaction. I had never thought much of the labor that goes into the articles of clothing we pick out at the stores. Once I was exposed to the footage of the factories and how the factory workers were beaten for expressing their needs for a better environment, I was baffled. I felt the emotion coming from the film almost as if I was giving the interview. How can people be so inhumane and be able to know humans are in this much pain working for close to no money and do nothing? There is no explanation.

 I was very uneducated in the subject of The True Cost, and the film exposed me to many new transgressions that these companies are doing. I never pressed the thoughts together that lower-cost clothing would result in factories having to make the conditions worse for the employees so they wouldn't lose the business of the large companies. This film has tremendously changed my attitude towards clothing. When I hear people talk about how their clothing was on sale, my mind immediately shifts to how the clothing was made and the distressed faces of the factory workers. I feel pessimistic about the future of the companies. Even though people are becoming informed on the issue, the truth still stands that people want clothes that are cheap and quickly made and people aren't willing to give workers more benefits because they will get the same result.

I completely agree with all your statements regarding the film. Just like you, I never really gave much thought to where our clothes come from, and why the fashion industry is so successful. I, too, was bewildered when I learned of all the horrible conditions that these workers have to endure, all while receiving essentially nothing in return. I will never look at fashion the same again, and like you, I will always be left wondering where exactly the clothes that I see everyday came from. Unfortunately, I also agree with your pessimism about the future of fashion companies, as I see no way that they will forfeit any profits by producing their products in a more expensive, humane manner.

I like the video, "The Ugly Truth Of Fast Fashion", so much. Hasan Minhaj, who is the compere, is so funny. But the content that Hasan brings out is serious and horrible. Hasan uses Zara and H&M, these two fast fashion brands as an example to explain how fast fashion is going to destroy our planet. IN the video, Hasan opens a pop-up clothing store called H-M, he sold the clothes he bought from H&M, and he labeled the prices by how much trash and natural resources it used when it was mad and how fack is the claim that those companies stated. For example, a hoddie that was made by H&M costs around 8 tons of water, and that is one of the lowest cost clothes in the store. That is so horrible. And a lady wants to buy an orange dress, which is claimed by H&M that it is econ-friendly, as it was made by econ-wool. But on the tap, the dress only contains 4% of wools, the rest of it is polyester, etc. Polyester is made of oil. How can that be eco-friendly? Those fast fashion companies are misleading us.  Most of the claims they made are full of shit. We can rely on them. If we want to put some effort into this, we should buy one less cloth or one-second hands clothes per year. If every American do this,  we can reduce a lot of CO2 gas release, which equals to half a million vehicle for a whole year using. This is a lot. Therefore, we should start to do something to save our planet not until it is too late. I think this action is a good start.

I wonder what kinds of regulations, exactly, could deal with this or should be used to deal with this. Let's say that Bernie wins, the Green New Deal is implemented: what could it include about fast fashion? In the best of worlds with all legislators on board, what are the correct things to require from manufacturers? 
         <br><br>

I'm asking because I genuinely don't know. Requiring that you have to have a certain % of a material to claim it as said material? Banning the use of non-sustainable materials entirely? Could something be done to legally restrict the disposability or quick uptime on fast-cycle fashion? Would that be going way too far into a far too controlling economy? I have literally no idea! 
         <br><br>

It's wild to me; I'm usually a gigantic policy wonk, but I've heard essentially nothing specifically about the fashion industry. I know little and understand less about it. Obviously we have to manufacture more locally so that we aren't shipping clothes overseas on massive oil-powered tankers, but... hm. I really don't know what would be best here. I sure hope environmental policy-makers are better at this than I am, lol.

The documentary "The True Cost" perceptively captures the concerns behind the clothing and fast fashion industry, centering around conflicts between greed & fear, power & poverty. I felt heartbroken when I learned about the Rana Plaza disaster and the subsequent impacts it caused on the victims’ families and children. It made me even more irritated when I saw how the minimum wage of 160 dollars per month was strongly refuted by the corporations. Comfortable and safe working condition should be guaranteed for all factory workers as they are the ones who pay the greatest physical efforts in the production of clothing. It seems to be a weird tradition that the workers who work in extreme conditions and complete overload work are given the least rewards in the production chain.
         <br><br>
Another point that caught my attention was a rhetorical question suggested by the documentary regarding whether happiness is based on stuff and consumption. This can be readily connected with Ken’s analogy of the cosmetics advertisement targeting at young girls. The social media is unconsciously creating and reinforcing stereotypes such as women should do makeup and dress up properly to be considered as decent and successfully, they have to wear corresponding seasonal clothes in order to meet up the current fashion trend. I was also exposed to many promotions by Youtubers or celebrities such as Kylie Jenner and James Charles, in which both of them present cosmetics products via social media and receive notable attention. As far as I’m concerned, the consumerism attitude couldn’t develop so quickly without the help of social media and we should have a systemic change and revolution of values, such as to value quality over quantity and necessity over stylishness.

I agree with your view on this movie completely. Before watching this movie I was aware that the fashion industry was not doing its best with the workers that are actually producing the clothes, however I had no idea that it was so bad. Watching the documentary I was really infuriated to see the conditions in which these people work. Something that really broke by heart was one of the women talking about the building collapse in Bangladesh. She was mentioning how her legs had been trapped by debris during the accident, although at this point we could only see from her chest up, and soon after they showed us how she had both legs amputated and was in a wheelchair. This really broke my heart because these people were seriously injured and now are forever handicapped and nobody takes responsibility, as well as most likely they will be out of a job forever and live in extreme poverty, even worse than most of these people already live in. As Vicky mentions I thought that companies not agreeing to pay a minimum wage of $160 dollars is ridiculous. To only think that here in America, you can spend far more than that amount in a single shopping trip, and people over there have to be able to survive and try to live decently with less than that amount, really helped me see how deeply Americans are in consumerism.
         <br><br>
I think that for Americans being consumers is simply a way of life. I have never thought about consuming material goods as a way to fill the void that most Americans aren't able to pay for important things like a home, college education, and life insurance until this movie mentioned it. I think that this is very ironic as instead of following the logical solution to try to afford these thing, which would be saving their money, Americans go out and buy items that they don't need, going and spending their money and making the important things in life even more unreachable.


<br><hr>
Vicky, I agree that the documentary “The True Cost” is an eye-opening and definitely thought-provoking film that made me question my actions and its impacts on the environment and the people living across the world. I find myself shopping at H&M for my clothes simply because they are cheap. When I am in the store and provided a sensory overload of clothing in all different shapes, sizes, and colors, I never stopped to think “how are these clothes so cheap?” The concept of fast-fashion was explained thoroughly in the documentary and I am very thankful for the opportunity to watch this documentary. I now have a better grasp of the fashion industry and the “greed, fear, power, and poverty” you mentioned in your comment. I am horrified to learn that the clothing I buy from fast-fashion stores is fueling the mass production of clothing under low wages and horrific working conditions. The Rana Plaza disaster was hard to watch and very emotional as the suffering of the workers were on full display. Not only is the fast-industry having an impact on the environment, the labor industry is also directly influenced by the success of fashion. By lowering the cost of the product without decreasing the cost of making said product, the laborers have to suffer as they are the ones being marginalized. 
         <br><br>
Ken’s video really got me thinking, “is it my fault or is it the companies fault?” I have come to the current conclusion that both sides have to admit their faults and move on to change the system. The companies that used the commercials in a children's tv show to sell people the concept of consumerism are despicable. I agree with you that celebrities such as James Charles and Kylie Jenner have big influences on the younger generation. I believe that the celebrities must change in order for the masses to change. I believe that companies played a huge role in creating the “consumer” culture and overtime have sold this idea to the public. It is our fault, however, if we do not change our ways despite knowing the consequences. For example, if I finished watching this documentary and am aware of the devastating effects of fast-fashion on the environment, laborers, and consumers, and I still go out and go on a shopping spree at a fashion-fashion store, then I am the one at fault. I also agree with you that there must be a systemic change from everyone.

For me, the most shocking part of Hasan Minhaj's "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion" was the way in which he exposed brands such as Zara and H&M for how truly unsustainable their supposedly eco-friendly fashion lines are. The fact that these brands claim that some of their pieces are made of recycled material, when in reality it's only the tag itself that's made of recycled material is absolutely ridiculous, and it's pretty mind blowing that they're able to get away with these fraudulent claims so easily. While I am definitely guilty of buying clothes from fast-fashion companies, after learning about the ways in which these companies blatantly lie to their customers and are really in no way sustainable, it's highly unlikely I'll be buying from them again. Along with this, another very jarring aspect of the video was the interview clip of a textile lobbyist who attempted to explain that river pollution due to textile production is good because it could turn those exposed to the pollutants into mutants like in the X-men movies...what?? I don't have many words to say about that except for the fact that it's scary that he was probably being serious when he said that. Lastly, I appreciate how Minhaj provided his audience not only with things they could do to combat this problem, but also what exactly the beneficial effect would be in terms of the environment if they did these things. This youtube video was overall very entertaining and as well as extremely informative, and I applaud Minhaj for using his platform to educate his viewers on the serious consequences of the fast fashion industry on the environment.

I agree with a great deal of the points that you made throughout your comment. I found Minhaj's video extremely compelling and informative. The way he uses his humor to captivate his audience and educates them on the subject of fast fashion is effective. Brands like H&M and Forever 21 are tempting for the younger population because of the social media pressure of keeping up with the trends and not posting two pictures in the same outfit, and these brands make keeping up with the trends possible with their low prices. The true cost of these low prices are not known to the average consumer that is only trying to keep their social standing by keeping up with the latest trends. 
         <br><br>
Before watching this video I was completely unaware of how these brands trying manipulating the consumers by putting up a facade of being environmentally friendly. As you pointed out, I could not believe that they would try to pretend that their clothing is made of recycled material, when in reality the tag on the clothing is what is actually made of recycled material. The beginning of various brands' annual reports all start out with half truths that are revealed near the end of the many hundreds of pages. This is another attempt of big brands are trying to manipulate their consumers, because if a consumer does read the beginning of the report they will find out these facts that paint the brand in good light, and since they don't get to the end they never find out about how their great statistics don't include certain things, such as factories.
         <br><br>
Overall, I believe that humor is a great way of trying to spread a message, and throughout this video Minhaj does a great job of entertaining and informing his audience.

I'm not going to sit here and say that I'm never going to buy from retailers like H&M and Zara again because that would be a complete lie. I like many other consumers have this problem in always wanting a good deal, and having to practically spend barely anything on trendy and fashionable articles of clothing. When I was in high school my mother would always take me to H&M to buy most of my clothes, I would say my closet is made up of 40-50% of clothes from H&M. Now that I have gotten older I don't shop as much as I did before within that retailer, taking both ENG 22 and now ENG 23 has made me more weary about my human consumption. It's not that I don't shop at these retailers, I now limit myself on the things I am buying and think to myself if I indeed really need this, or if spending money on this jacket would last me the whole year. Minhaj video shows an exceptional solution for us consumers to view fast fashion in whole other way, if we limit ourselves to a certain amount of articles of clothing and use our clothing longer than expected, then we could reduce our carbon footprint by about 30% percent. The average American gets rid of 80 pounds of clothing a year, 80 POUNDS! That's insane, I remember when I was younger my mother would have me sort out clothes that I no longer wanted or fit me so we could donate them to our local Salvation Army. We probably donated 5 large bags of clothes, not thinking much about it then, I thought we were doing a good thing because we were donating our clothes to people who needed it more than us. Now as I am older, I look back of how much of our clothes perhaps got taken to a dumping landfill, so much waste produced. Although I am not 100% there on reducing my carbon footprint, I am slowly but surely doing my best to implicate both Ken's and Minhaj solutions in my everyday life in trying to combat the issues within climate change.

The most jarring part of "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion," in my opinion, was how unsustainably produced even the "eco friendly" clothes were. Growing up with two brothers, hand-me-downs have always been a part of my life. I could not imagine being as wasteful as the average person that Hasan Minhaj describes when talking about the waste created by the average person's shopping habits. Luckily, however, this is an easy issue to help with. If everyone were to buy one clothing item second-hand each year instead of buying it new, it would make a substantial difference

Growing up with older sisters, I completely understand how clothing gets cycled down and there is a limited need to go out and buy more. I also think this philosophy could be applied to fashion in general, reducing the need to produce fresh, new clothes and making use of those already in circulation. I found it quite shocking to realize that every piece of clothing has been touched by human hands before being bought by consumers. This means that even the most irrelevant, cheap shirt I may own was once an accomplishment to have been made by another. Although this makes logical sense, I think it is an unknown realization to many, as we do not value our clothing and the effort that goes into making it like we should. On the topic of placing blame on either consumers or producers for the way the economy is currently, I believe it is up to the companies to be honest and thoughtful in their business and that they are responsible for the economy’s tendency to put money over humanity. However, despite it being the producer’s responsibility, I think change will only come when consumers force them to take it. Buyers must escape from the trap of consumerism in order to encourage these large corporations to fix what they have broken.

I agree and can relate with your comment. Clothes have been passed down in my family for years and I had no idea how much it was helping the world environmentally. It is hard to believe that the average person buys 68 new pieces of clothing every day when I consider the amount of clothes that I have personally bought over the last couple years. People are always trying to be caught up with the trends and don't ever consider anything besides the money they are spending. I think the way that Hasan Minhaj presents this using comedy in just about a half an hour is perfect and it was very educational as well.

This youtube video was very entertaining and funny I enjoyed it a lot. The best part though was that it was very informative and caused me to think about buying clothes. Now I’ve already wanted to become a minimalist and I think I’ve done a good job except buying one sweatshirt, but this just shows me that I should only be shopping a thrift stores for clothes. I have enough clothes already to where I don't need to buy anymore clothes, yet if I ever have the urge I should thrift. The statistics in this video are scary though as I have shopped at H&M and because my sister and mom enjoy shopping. I really can’t believe all the horrible things that companies do just to make more money, such as abusing workers and destroying the environment. People need to take action against these companies by not buying as much and also protesting them, but also governments should take action, even though I doubt they will. Still, either the governments or people need to adjust in order to save many people and more importantly the environment before we destroy all of it just because we want to look good. The fast fashion is producing an extraordinary amount of clothing and it is working well, which proves the materialistic value of America and other well developed countries. I also think that it is absolute nonsense that these companies can advertise as green and get away with it even though they really don’t practice any eco-friendly behavior. People need a source of correct information because people are very gullible and like to believe in stuff that benefits them. Like if people were told that actually french fries were the healthiest food on the planet, people would be eager to accept it as they enjoy french fries and now they think they are healthy. Yet when people are told, such as in the video, that companies such as H&M and lulu lemon are bad, they are less encouraged to believe it as it negatively impacts them. Therefore, people are in need of a source of correct unbiased information in order for people to understand the problems and benefits of things such as fashion or eating or literally anything. The news nowadays is very biased both ways and I think that people just need a source like Hassan Minhaj who is entertaining, yet informative.

 I really enjoyed reading your comment. I think it is great that you are trying to lead a more minimalist lifestyle and I hope you are successful in that. I agree that the recent films and lectures presented in the course have made me more conscious of my carbon footprint and has inspired me to take more steps to be more eco-friendly. Thrifting is a great idea and something I used to do a lot back home with friends. We used to put together bags of clothes that no longer fit us or that we simply didn't wear anymore and took them with us to one of our favorite stores, Buffalo Exchange. It is a company that sells used clothes as well as pays people for bringing in new items for their stock. My girlfriends and I would love going to Buffalo Exchange to see how much money we could make for our used clothes and then look for some great new finds to add to our wardrobes. Although this company sounds like they are making an effort to combat our country's growing consumerism, it is still stuck in the trap of fast fashion. Buffalo Exchange takes donations but will only accept higher end fashion or articles of clothing "that match their style." This almost defeats the purpose of taking donations and is a prime example of the way that fast fashion has turned our four seasons into 52 made up ones. 
         <br><br>

The film, The True Cost, did a wonderful job elaborating on this idea of fast fashion. One of my favorite quotes from the film was, "Environmental rights and human rights are lost when everything is focused on making profits for the big companies." I feel like this statement touches on one of the most important topics addressed in The True Cost. It made clear that in the minds of big companies, increasing capital is the only thing that matters. The workers in these third world countries, that are barely surviving and many in fact are dying from disease, are products of this corrupt system. In fact, these major companies don't purchase these third world factories for the main reason of avoiding the consequences of factory disasters, poverty wages, and the ongoing violence against workers that are harming their workers. It was made very obvious that they want profit at all costs after I saw the violent images and scenes of police brutality, worker protests, and factory accidents presented in the film. It was so horrific that it became hard for me to watch at a few points in the film. I breaks my heart to know that my consumption is affecting the lives of these poor people and that without any systemic change, I won't be able to do anything to help. 
         <br><br>

This then leads to my last point. The thing that stuck with me the most after watching The True Cost, was the idea that our nation's economic system is a system that "cannot be criticized". I learned that a healthy society subjects it's component systems to criticism, but our nation's economic system, capitalism, cannot and has not been questioned. This was very frustrating to hear as I realized that the only way to attempt to get a hold on our nation's growing consumerism is to question capitalism. This also made this issue seem that much harder to solve. Similarly, Beckett, to how you said that people are in need of a source of correct unbiased information, in order to understand the problems of things such as fashion, I think we need it in order to better understand how we can make a difference. This is an issue that needs to be solved, not just talked about. I also agree that when people hear bad things about the things that they enjoy, they are less likely to agree with those facts. Therefore, I also believe that when something is described as a challenge or difficult, most people retreat in fear and pass on the issue to someone else. They may even lose their interest altogether and tend to just leave it for someone "smarter" or for "the system" to figure it out. Fast fashion seems to be one of those kinds of issues and that is very hard for me to accept.
